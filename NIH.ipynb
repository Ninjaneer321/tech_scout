to\\nimprove the efficiency of data flow from the point of collection to the time at which performance-based\\nfeedback is provided to stakeholders. Current limitations of the QI data cycle include: (a) reliance on hand\\nabstraction for data collection; (b) a retrospective and episodic (e.g.: quarterly, bi-annually, etc.) approach to\\nanalysis and feedback which creates a time lag from when the hospital’s performance is declining and when it is\\nmade aware; (c) small clusters of clinically meaningful poor performance may go of undetected using current\\nepisodic analytic structures. To address the first limitation, modern data science methods (MDSMs) could be\\nused to automate the collection of some, or all, of the variables within surgical QI registries. Full or partial\\nautomation of data collection could allow the substantial resources currently committed to manual data\\nabstraction to be repurposed to support more continuous, proactive engagement in local QI activities. To\\naddress the limitations associated with episodic performance evaluation, alternative approaches for analyzing\\ndata in more real-time could be applied to provide an early warning of declining performance. The Veterans\\nAffairs (VA) Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) is one of the most successful and longest-\\nstanding national clinical registries used for surgical QI and has been the template for a number of similar\\nprograms in the private sector. As such, VASQIP represents an excellent model for evaluating alternative\\napproaches to data collection and analysis that could allow for more efficient data flow through the quality\\nimprovement cycle and enhance national surgical QI efforts. The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate\\nalternative, potentially more efficient strategies that can be readily implemented within the existing\\ninfrastructure of contemporary surgical QI programs and aid in the more efficient flow of data. The specific\\naims are to: (1) develop and validate MDSMs to use structured and unstructured electronic health record data\\nto automate cardiac VASQIP data collection; (2) compare the risk-adjusted CUSUM (a statistical process\\ncontrol methodology borrowed from industry) to quarterly observed-to-expected ratios (i.e.: VASQIP’s current\\napproach to assessing performance) for evaluating VA hospital cardiac surgical performance; (3) conduct semi-\\nstructured interviews with diverse stakeholder groups to set a national research agenda for expansion and\\nimprovement of surgical QI programs. This mixed-methods proposal will involve observational studies using\\nVASQIP and VA Corporate Data Warehouse data for patients who underwent cardiac surgery at a VA hospital\\nbetween 2016 and 2020 as well as qualitative interviews with stakeholders who can help to inform future\\nchanges that can improve the data available within VASQIP. This project is important and novel because it will\\nprovide real-world, generalizable data that can be used to inform national surgical and non-surgical QI\\ninitiatives within VA and the private sector.\",\"project_title\":\"Using Modern Data Science Methods and Advanced Analytics to Improve the Efficiency, Reliability, and Timeliness of Cardiac Surgical Quality Data\",\"phr_text\":\"Existing national surgical quality improvement programs have not significantly updated their processes for\\ndata collection, data analysis, or providing feedback to stakeholders in decades.

The National Academy of Medicine report underscored that 18 or more different clinical disciplines or roles may be involved in patients' comprehensive cancer care. Accordingly, the National Cancer Institute prioritized the need to improve team-based cancer care. The multi-team system (MTS) perspective offers a theoretical framework to examine interdependent work among multiple teams of healthcare professionals (HCPs). To achieve better system performance, MTS theory submits that the system must develop effective communication and coordination. Electronic health records (EHRs) serve a central role in connecting virtual care teams, i.e., groups of HCPS who provide care to the same patients, work at different times and locations, and support their work with technology-mediated communication. Through EH Rs, virtual care teams develop a distributed communication system for encoding, storing, and retrieving patient information, which can be examined as a communication network with individual HCPs representing information agents and communication linkages among them indicating information flow. Understanding this network form of communication and factors influencing its effectiveness will be crucial for the practice of virtual care teams. However, with the explosive growth of EHR data, these \\\"digital traces\\\" of complex teamwork interactions provide data of unprecedented size and complexity to study MTSs in their natural healthcare settings. We propose to develop methods for ML-based network analysis of EHR data and visual interpretation of analysis results for understanding and promoting more effective communication and teamwork in cancer care team systems with a focus on studying cancer care MTSs of breast, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancer patients. Our project uniquely addresses the Transformative Data Science research theme. The interdisciplinary collaboration in our project will offer a diverse basis for creative problem solving and validation. We expect this project will make fundamental contributions to the advancements of visual analytics technology and explainable Al and machine learning for optimizing healthcare processes, specifically making impact to future team-based cancer care.\",\"project_title\":\"SCH: Smart EHR Data Analytics to Enhance Cancer Care Multiteam Systems\",\"phr_text\":\"Cancer continues to rank as the second leading cause of death in the US.

account for up to 70% of acute care costs. Among these “super-utilizer”\\npatients, homelessness is a robust social determinant of acute care utilization. Through a field-based\\ndashboard and clinical aids, the Hot Spotter Analytic program assists Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) with\\ntargeting and tailoring care for the highest-need homeless Veterans. However, many Veterans identified by the\\nAnalytics do not engage in supportive services that reduce risk for acute care utilization. Peer Specialists (PS)\\nare a high-value workforce that can facilitate Veterans’ engagement in care. Yet, there is a need to enhance\\nthe PS role with a structured approach that can capitalize on known facilitators of care engagement among\\nhomeless Veterans. Whole Health Coaching (WHC) is one such approach. By focusing on patients’ values and\\ngoals rather than treatment of specific conditions, WHC reduces patients’ stigma regarding their care needs\\nand increases patient activation and well-being, which can increase engagement in supportive services.\\nSignificance: By training a high-value workforce in a patient-centered approach to care that facilitates\\nengagement in supportive services, our proposed research can reduce homeless Veterans’ reliance on acute\\ncare services, thereby minimizing the financial burden these patients exert on the care system. This proposal\\nresponds to several VA HSR&D Research Priorities including Mental Health, Healthcare Value, Primary Care\\nPractice, Healthcare Informatics, and Whole Health, as well as VA-related Legislative Priorities (MISSION Act).\\nInnovation and Impact: A critical innovation of this research is use of data-driven processes (Hot Spotter\\nAnalytics) to better target and tailor care for high-need, homeless Veterans in VHA. Our proposed research is\\nalso innovative in that it seeks to integrate the Analytics with a workforce (PS) and approach to care (WHC)\\nthat are rapidly expanding in primary care services VA-wide. These features of our target intervention are\\nconsistent with the National Academy of Medicine’s recommendations for high-quality care for high-need\\npatients. Finally, by focusing on the development of personal health goals that are aligned with patients’\\npriorities and values, WHC is a key innovation to be added to existing VHA services for homeless Veterans.\\nSpecific Aims: The goal of this project is to integrate use of Hot Spotter Analytics with Peer Specialists trained\\nin Whole Health Coaching (PS-WHC) and evaluate whether this approach reduces homeless Veterans’\\nfrequent use of acute care. Aim 1: Conduct an RCT to test whether receipt of PS-WHC (vs. Enhanced Usual\\nCare; EUC) predicts (1a) lower acute care utilization, (1b) better health-related outcomes, and whether (1c) the\\neffects of PS-WHC on 1a and 1b are mediated by increased (i) patient activation and well-being, and (ii)\\naccess to supportive services. Aim 2: Conduct a process evaluation to inform VA's potential widespread\\nimplementation of Hot Spotter Analytics + PS-WHC on PACTs. Aim 3: Conduct a Budget Impact Analysis (BIA)\\nto determine the impact on total costs of VA care due to implementing PS-WHC.\\nMethodology: Using a Hybrid Type 1 design at the Palo Alto and Bedford VAs, 220 Veterans on PACT panels\\nwho are (i) on the VA Homeless Registry, and (ii) persistent super-utilizers of acute care will complete a\\nbaseline interview, be randomized to either EUC (usual PACT care + Hot Spotter Analytics and text reminders\\nof appointments) or EUC plus 12 sessions of PS-WHC over 12 weeks, and be re-interviewed at 3, 6, and 9\\nmonths. For Aim 2, the CFIR framework will guide key informant interviews with 7 PACT staff/leaders and 12\\npatients from each site. For the BIA, we will include only VA costs from VA, Fee Basis care, and Choice care.\\nCosts will be estimated per patient for all treatment beginning with randomization and continuing for 9 months.\\nNext Steps/Implementation: Depending on the results, we will work with our VACO partners in the National\\nCenter for Homelessness Among Veterans, the Office of Patient Centered Care & Cultural Transformation, and\\nthe Office of Mental Health & Suicide Prevention to conduct a large multisite implementation trial.\",\"project_title\":\"Using Data Analytics and Targeted Whole Health Coaching to Reduce Frequent Utilization of Acute Care among Homeless Veterans\",\"phr_text\":\"Acute care utilization contributes substantially to the cost of healthcare for Veterans.

Team, focusing on deriving knowledge from real-world\\ndata through complex analytic workflows, integrated to the Translator Knowledge Graph, and\\nserved via tools like Big GIM and the Translator Standard API.\\nThe problem: We aim to solve the “first mile” problem of translational research: how to\\nintegrate the multitude of dynamic small-to-large data sets that have been produced by the\\nresearch and clinical communities, but that are in different locations, processed in different\\nways, and in a variety of formats that may not be mutually interoperable. Integrating these data\\nsets requires significant manual work downloading, reformatting, parsing, indexing and\\nanalyzing each data set in turn. The technical and ethical challenges of accessing diverse\\ncollections of big data, efficiently selecting information relevant to different users’ interests, and\\nextracting the underlying knowledge are problems that remain unsolved. Here, we propose to\\nleverage lessons distilled from our previous and ongoing big data analysis projects to develop a\\nhighly automated tool for removing these bottlenecks, enabling researchers to analyze and\\nintegrate many valuable data sets with ease and efficiency, and making the data FAIR [1].\\nPlan: (AIM 1) We will analyze and extract knowledge from rich real-world biomedical data sets\\n(listed in the Resources page) in the domains of wellness, cancer, and large-scale clinical\\nrecords. (AIM 2) We will formalize methods from Aim 1 to develop DOCKET, a novel tool for\\nonboarding and integrating data from multiple domains. (AIM 3) We will work with other teams\\nto adapt DOCKET to additional knowledge domains. ■ The DOCKET tool will offer 3 modules:\\n(1) DOCKET Overview: Analysis of, and knowledge extraction from, an individual data set. (2)\\nDOCKET Compare: Comparing versions of the same data set to compute confidence values,\\nand comparing different data sets to find commonalities. (3) DOCKET Integrate: Deriving\\nknowledge through integrating different data sets. ■ Researchers will be able to parameterize\\nthese functions, resolve inconsistencies, and derive knowledge through the command line,\\nJupyter notebooks, or other interfaces as specified by Translator Standards. ■ The outcome will\\nbe a collection of nodes and edges, richly annotated with context, provenance and confidence\\nlevels, ready for incorporation into the Translator Knowledge Graph (TKG). ■ All analyses and\\nderived knowledge will be stored in standardized formats, enabling querying through the\\nReasoner Std API and ingestion into downstream AI assisted machine learning. ■ Example\\nquestions this will allow us to address include: (Wellness) Which clinical analytes, metabolites,\\nproteins, microbiome taxa, etc. are significantly correlated, and which changing analytes predict\\ntransition to which disease? [2,3] (Cancer) Which gene mutations in any of X pathways are\\nassociated with sensitivity or resistance to any of Y drugs, in cell lines from Z tumor types? (All\\ndata sets) Which data set entities are similar to this one? Are there significant clusters? What\\ndistinguishes between the clusters? What significant correlations of attributes can be observed?\\nHow can this set of entities be expanded by adding similar ones? How do these N versions of\\nthis data set differ, and how stable is each knowledge edge as the data set changes over time?\\nCollaboration strengths: Our team has extensive experience with biomedical and domainagnostic\\ndata analytics, integrating multiple relevant data types: omics, clinical measurements\\nand electronic health records (EHRs). We have participated in large collaborative consortia and\\nhave subject matter experts willing to advise on proper data interpretation. Our application\\nsynergizes with those of other Translator teams (see Letters of Collaboration).\\nChallenges: Data can come in a bewildering diversity of formats. Our solution will be modular,\\nwill address the most common formats first, and will leverage established technologies like\\nDataFrames and importers (like pandas.io) where possible. Mapping nodes and edge types\\nonto standard ontologies is crucial for knowledge integration; we will collaborate with the\\nStandards component to maximize success.\",\"project_title\":\"DOCKET:

named EVIDARA to\\nevaluate returns from queries in knowledge\\nsources (KS) using a new epistemology: The\\n“reasoning” is based on checking against empirical\\nevidence available in raw data (measurements)\\ninstead of deductive reasoning\\n(FIG.►). EVIDARA will assist the Autonomous\\nRelay System (ARS) to identify paths in returned\\nknowledge graphs (KG) that may\\nconflict with real-word evidence and to relay queries to appropriate specialty KS or database.\\n(2) Problem addressed: EHR and multi-omics raw data from large cohorts, if properly preprocessed\\n[e.g., by Knowledge Providers, such as the DOCKET, see application by Dr. Glusman],\\noffers a new opportunity for ad hoc systematic extraction of empirical knowledge on relationships\\n(“Protein P level correlates with risk for disease D”) instead of relying on specific epidemiological\\nanalyses. The problem in harnessing raw data for empirical support in lieu of deductive reasoning\\nis that the KGs to be evaluated are extracted from knowledge sources of distinct types and that\\nthe relevance of paths depends on the query context Q. Also the ARA algorithm should be scalable\\nto digest the emerging multi-omics data from projects like All-of-Us, the UK Biobank.\\n(3) Plan for implementation: Research will be conducted to evaluate a new epistemic realm:\\nmake empirical evidence central to “reasoning”. We have assembled a set of functioning tools to\\novercome the chicken-egg problem of getting a project started and jumpstart development and\\ntesting of EVIDARA: (i) SPOKE, one of the largest biomedical knowledge network (KN) has integrated\\n25 diverse of KS into a single (neo4j) network database of 2 million nodes and will serve\\nas testing ground for research well before we can use KGs produced by the Knowledge Providers.\\n(ii) Algorithms that use raw data from EHR and multi-omics studies to evaluate the returned KGs.\\nFor instance, we compute weights of all nodes in the entire KN through a random-walk algorithm\\nbiased by their role for a given condition Q observed in the raw data. (iii) Raw data beyond EHR:\\nmulti-omics profiles from a study at ISB with >10k variables which vastly exceeds coverage of\\nobservable nodes in KNs offered by EHRs. Example query: “Vitamin K stimulates stem-cell signaling,\\nthus could promote cancer. What is the molecular pathway? Mechanisms returned as KG\\nwill be pruned by EVIDARA and checked against correlative evidence in the raw data: Is there\\nevidence that taking Vit. K or its antagonist reduces cancer risk?”. Importantly, since EVIDARA\\nlearns on a network of many types of KS, it will provide information to the ARS about which type\\nof KS/Knowledge Provider to invoke next (in iterative queries) to improve the knowledge graph.\\n(4) Expertise & resources: The MPIs, Drs. S. Baranzini (UCSF) and S. Huang (ISB) are researchers\\nwith long history of working with medical big data, thus offering technical expertise and the\\ncritical SME perspective. SB’s team has created and maintains SPOKE. The uniquely self-contained\\nSPOKE network will allow NCATS staff to test other ARAs. SH brings decades of experience\\nin research of disease mechanisms and medical epistemology. His team will provide multi-omics\\ndatasets and data analytics expertise. With his prior work in the NCATS Translator program, he is\\nwell poised to maximize team science efficiency and help convert its vision into tangible results.\\n(5) Potential challenges. (i) Quality of evidential support depends on quality of raw data. A quality\\ncontrol is beyond the scope of EVIDARA but could be provided by Knowledge Providers focusing\\non new multi-omics data sets (e.g. DOCKET). (ii) Testing EVIDARA on other KS from Knowledge\\nProviders) may be slowed down by interoperability issues (e.g. incompatible identifiers).

ICECAP (PRECICECAP) is to discover novel biomarker\\nsignatures of post cardiac arrest brain and extracerebral organ failure that predict treatment responsiveness\\nand long-term recovery. We will achieve this by partnering with the ICECAP trial, a response-adaptive dose\\nfinding clinical research trial that seeks to determine the optimal duration of post-arrest hypothermia. Cardiac\\narrest is a major public health problem with high morbidity and mortality. Four in five patients hospitalized\\nafter cardiac arrest have significant brain injury, and death from neurologic damage is common. Improving\\nsurvival and functional recovery is a critical public health objective and will require innovative approaches.\\nThe current clinical situation is unprecedented. Currently post-CA brain injury is an acute, sudden critical\\nillness with major knowledge gaps about how best to characterize severity of injury and to identify which\\nindividual patients are likely to benefit from specific neuroprotective strategies. Thus, development of high-\\nperforming biomarker signatures is a critical need and would translate in to immediate changes in care. We\\nhypothesize that not all patients are identical (i.e. there will be a heterogeneity of treatment effect) and that\\nthrough our innovative, multi-parametric data driven approach, we will be able to identify novel signatures that\\ndefine subgroups of patients. Advanced data science and analytical approaches will allow the identification of\\nthese subgroups that was previously not possible. These subgroups will be clinically important insofar as they\\nwill indicate differential responses to treatment and different trajectories of functional recovery. This project\\nwill acquire high resolution multi-modal data early in the disease course that will allow us to address these\\ncurrent knowledge gaps and improve our understanding of the disease in the early acute setting when\\ninterventions can improve outcome. The knowledge learned here will be applied to develop personalized\\ntreatments for cardiac arrest survivors, addressing the NIH's and our goals of lengthening life and reducing\\ndisability.\",\"project_title\":\"PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP)\",\"phr_text\":\"Project Narrative\\nPost-cardiac arrest injury affects the brain and other critical organs and is a major public health problem\\ncausing significant death and disability.

Rapid decline,\\ncharacterized by accelerated loss of lung function, is common for CF patients, and cannot be explained or\\npredicted by CFTR/gene dysfunction alone. Mapping the environmental exposures and community\\ncharacteristics (geomarkers) that predict patient-specific rapid decline and providing tools for earlier detection\\nand monitoring at the center level are essential to transforming the precision of CF clinical care, and offer an\\nopportunity to adjust interventions to prevent irreversible lung damage. The translation of these tools into\\npractice is further hindered by continued use of antiquated statistical methods that ignore the interplay between\\nnonlinear lung function and recurrent pulmonary exacerbations in the clinical course of CF, disregard known\\nmortality biases that can lead to inaccurate projections of rapid decline, and do not leverage extant geographic\\ndata on geomarkers, such as air quality or neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, to improve prediction of\\nrapid decline. In this proposal, we will utilize comprehensive geocoding algorithms, novel statistical methods\\nand powerful computational medicine tools for integration into clinical algorithms for the detection to drive early\\nintervention of rapid lung disease progression. The overall objective of this research is to leverage a rich CF\\nregistry, extant national and local environmental data sources and prospectively collected study data to\\naccurately forecast the onset of rapid decline in individual patients, and to develop a feasible medical-\\nmonitoring tool that positively impacts CF point-of-care decision-making. Our overarching hypothesis is that\\ninteractive computational medicine tools for dynamic prediction and clinical surveillance of rapid pulmonary\\ndecline in CF will enhance local disease monitoring. This will be accomplished by incorporating both\\nestablished and novel environmental exposures and community characteristics of CF patients. Our specific\\naims are to 1) phenotype patients who experience early, rapid pulmonary decline informed by environmental\\nexposures; 2) transform dynamic prediction of rapid lung-function decline and exacerbations in CF patients\\nthrough high-dimensional, multi-level joint model mapping with environmental factors; 3) design and implement\\ndecision support capabilities that monitor real-time lung-function decline and risk of exacerbations for\\npersonalized, center-specific CF patient management. Once systems to accurately and precisely predict rapid\\ndecline are in place, better prospective treatment decisions will become possible, resulting in better patient\\noutcomes and improved precision medicine/care.\",\"project_title\":\"R01- Mapping environmental contributions to rapid lung disease progression in cystic fibrosis\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\nThe proposed research is relevant to public health because having clinical tools for early detection and timely\\ntreatment of rapid pulmonary decline in cystic fibrosis will improve the real-world effectiveness of clinical\\ninterventions.

utilization\\namong minority populations by improving coverage for dental insurance via Medicaid and Children’s Health\\nInsurance Program (CHIP), large oral health disparities remain with Black and Hispanic children having the\\npoorest oral health of any racial groups in the US.5-8 In addition to lack of access to recommended care, individual\\nhealth behaviors (e.g., poor dietary and oral hygiene) and community- and provider-related structural factors\\nalso contribute to the high risk of severe dental caries in minority populations.6,9 State Medicaid and CHIP dental\\nprograms are encouraged to consider strategies to reduce oral health disparities in their delivery system\\nimprovement efforts,6 however, they are challenged with improving quality and reducing quality disparities among\\nhigh-need beneficiaries in a cost-effective way.6 Steps toward successful program improvements include the\\nability to validly measure the value of care (defined by both health outcomes and costs) delivered to their\\nbeneficiaries, as well as incorporating racial/ethnic disparities in the assessment. There is a critical gap in our\\nunderstanding of the influence of race/ethnicity and its interaction with multilevel risk factors on disparities in\\nquality and oral health outcomes. The scientific objective of this research plan is to study multilevel determinants\\nof oral health and disparities in quality of dental care and assess the value of improving care and eliminating\\nracial/ethnic disparities in quality. In Aim 1, we will develop a risk prediction model of severe dental caries by\\napplying machine-learning based survival analysis4,10 on electronic health record (EHR) data to understand the\\ninfluence of race/ethnicity on progression of severe caries and explore heterogenous treatment effects of dental\\ncare. In Aim 2, we will analyze individual-level claims in Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) data combined with\\nmultiple data sources to comprehensively measure racial/ethnic disparities in overall quality of dental care, using\\nevidence-based quality indicators, and identify modifiable structural risk factors creating disparities. In Aim 3,\\nincorporating results from Aims 1 and 2, a microsimulation model of severe caries, integrating individual-level\\ndata with data on key contextual factors, will be developed and used to assess the cost-effectiveness and value\\nof improvements in care stemming from dental quality measures and eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in\\nquality. Findings from this study will support decision-making by policymakers and stakeholders, and will form\\nthe basis of an R01 application to study novel strategies that target underserved and vulnerable populations.\\nThis research plan is complemented by a career development plan that builds on the applicant’s background in\\nhealth policy and decision science. Specifically, this career development plan outlines new training in three\\nareas: (1) oral health epidemiology, (2) health disparities research, and (3) advanced analytics methods.

healthy neurodevelopment and the mechanisms underlying threats to youths’ mental\\nhealth. Brain development unfolds on multiple levels, but the field lacks a comprehensive understanding of\\nwhether the trajectories of development are fundamentally similar or different across modalities (e.g., structure\\nand function), and how they reflect developmental mechanisms associated with puberty or age (or both). The\\nproposed research aims to generate a systematic and comprehensive multimodal account of typical\\nneurodevelopment from ages 5 to 21, with a particular focus on a) identifying age versus pubertal- and\\nhormonal-based mechanisms that undergird development in childhood and adolescence; b) systematic\\nanalyses across brain structure, function, and connectivity using state-of-the-art acquisition and analysis\\napproaches; and c) evaluation of maturational variation in multimodal coupling across brain systems/\\nmodalities as a function of development. Once established, this multimodal model of typical neurodevelopment\\nwill be used to test a conceptual model proposing that early pubertal timing leads to intensification of\\ninternalizing symptoms due to disruptions in brain development, including alterations in multimodal coupling.\\nSpecifically, models of the impact of early pubertal timing predict either further enhanced coupling with early\\npuberty (neurodevelopmental acceleration) or disruptions in coupling due to neurodevelopmental delays. To\\ncompare these competing models and advance our understanding of the neurodevelopmental pathways by\\nwhich early pubertal timing contributes to the rise of internalizing symptoms during adolescence, the research\\nwill use both hypothesis-driven methods and novel validated analysis pipelines for data-driven exploration of\\ndevelopmental changes in coupling, with careful attention to robustness and replication. The primary dataset\\nwill be the Human Connectome Project in Development (HCPD), a large, NIH funded, multimodal brain\\nimaging dataset that includes a comprehensive assessment of brain structure, function, and connectivity paired\\nwith pubertal and hormonal measures and extensive behavioral and clinical measures in both a cross-sectional\\ncohort of N=1300+ youth ages 5 to 21, and a longitudinal cohort (N=252) spanning ages 9 to 17 capturing the\\npubertal transition. This sample is purposefully strong diversity in race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.\\nKey findings will be replicated to ensure robustness and generalizability in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive\\nDevelopment (ABCD) longitudinal study. Our Specific Aims are to: A1) Establish a comprehensive, systematic\\naccount of age-and pubertal-linked pathways of brain development across multiple modalities of brain structure\\nand function; A2) Test hypotheses about the relations of age and pubertal development to coupling across\\nbrain modalities; and A3) Test hypotheses about the neurodevelopmental mechanisms contributing to the rise\\nin internalizing symptoms during the pubertal transition.\",\"project_title\":\"Characterizing pubertal and age mechanisms of neurodevelopment and association with rising internalizing symptoms\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\nThe proposed research will use two of the largest datasets on child and adolescent neurodevelopment in\\nexistence to inform how puberty influences the development of the brain and emerging risk for mental illness.\\nUsing measures of puberty and hormones, paired with multiple metrics of brain development, we will\\ndisentangle the relationship between age, puberty, and hormone concentrations and brain development, and\\nestablish how different measures of brain development interrelate across puberty.

Quantitative image analysis has become an\\nindispensable tool for biologists using microscopy throughout basic biological and biomedical research.\\n Quantifying images is now a critical, widespread need as imaging experiments continue to grow in scale,\\nsize, dimensionality, scope, modality, and complexity. Many biologists are missing out on the quantitative\\nbioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and/or usable software for their needs, or lack of\\naccess to training. The Center brings together the Carpenter laboratory at the Broad Institute and the Eliceiri\\nlaboratory at the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and in doing so brings together the two most popular open\\nsource bioimage analysis projects, ImageJ (including ImageJ2 and FIJI) and CellProfiler. Through the\\ncollaborative development and dissemination of open source image analysis software, as well as training\\nevents and resources, the Center will empower thousands of researchers to apply advanced analytics in\\ninnovative ways to address new experimental areas.\\n Building on the team’s expertise developing algorithms and user­friendly software for use in biology under\\nreal­world conditions, the Center will focus on two Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects:\\ndeep learning­based image processing, and accessibility of image­processing algorithms for biologists. This\\nwork will not occur in isolation at the Center; rather, the Center will nucleate a larger community working on\\nthese two areas and serve as a catalyst and organizing force to create software and resources shared by all.\\n The Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) will serve a major role in driving the TR&D work: our teams are\\naccustomed to working deeply and iteratively on problems side by side and with frequent feedback from\\nbiologists. This will ensure that important cell biological problems drive the work of the Center. The DBPs\\nreflect tremendous variety in terms of biological questions, model systems, imaging modalities, and researcher\\nexpertise and will ensure robustness of our tools for the widest possible impact on the community. Continuing\\nthe teams’ track record with ImageJ and CellProfiler, two mature open source bioimage analysis software\\nprojects critical to the work of biologists worldwide, the Center will also assist and train biologists in applying\\nthe latest computational techniques to important biological problems involving images.\\n In short, the need for robust, accurate, and readily usable software is more urgent than ever.

Summary\\nGenomic data are vital for advancing medical research and achieving breakthroughs. However, disclosure of\\ngenomic data has serious privacy implications that can lead to a loss of trust from data contributors and restricting\\nresearchers’ access to data. To facilitate data-driven genomic research, it is crucial to address the privacy risks\\nin data sharing and to develop privacy-preserving solutions to protect study participants. This project will study\\nthe privacy risks in realistic attack models and develop privacy methods that balance individual privacy and the\\nutility of shared data. Overall, the proposed solutions will enable institutions to share high utility data while\\nproviding strong privacy assurance to data contributors, facilitating data collection and improving data usability.\\nIn the first aim, a privacy-preserving data publication framework will be developed to “safely anonymize” genomic\\ndata and optimize the released data toward application needs. The framework will protect individuals from re-\\nidentification and also prevent inference attacks that may be conducted using publicly available phenotypes (e.g.,\\neye/hair color). In the second aim, customizable privacy solutions will be developed against realistic adversarial\\nmodels when data statistics are released. Building on recent privacy models, the proposed solutions will account\\nfor the adversary's external knowledge and customizable sensitive information to effectively strike a balance\\nbetween privacy and utility, improving data usability compared to standard differential privacy models. This\\nproject will advance current solutions for genomic data anonymization and improve the usability of differential\\nprivacy and its variants, with the goal of facilitating highly usable and privacy-preserving data sharing. This work\\nwill widen the access to genomic data, promote transparency, and facilitate reproducibility for genomic\\napplications. This project is in line with the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI),\\nas the proposed techniques enhance data sharing and promote collaborative genomic research.\\nThe applicant’s career goal is to become an independent investigator with a primary appointment in a biomedical\\ninformatics program, with a focus on genome privacy technologies, at a major US research university. His long-\\nterm objective is to develop new privacy-preserving technologies for data sharing and data analytics, in order to\\nfacilitate collaborative research efforts in genomics and precision medicine. The applicant proposes a carefully\\ndesigned career development plan, which includes a variety of training activities to complement his computer\\nscience skills with additional biomedical knowledge and smooth his transition into an independent researcher.\\nThe UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics will serve as an exceptional platform for his career\\ndevelopment, given the experience of several faculty in privacy technologies, computational biology, genomic\\nmedicine, and close collaboration with other institutions worldwide.\",\"project_title\":\"SAFEGENOMES: Strong privacy Assurance For Effective GENOME Sharing\",\"phr_text\":\"Project Narrative\\nWhile sharing genomic data holds great promise for advancing biomedical research and personalized medicine,\\nthe uniqueness of the genomic data and the rich information they carry can put participants’ privacy at risk.

enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation\\ninterventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological\\nmomentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological\\ndata such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity\\nto others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is\\ncharacterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive\\ninterventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in\\nthe moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on\\nobservations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and\\nenvironmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse\\nrisk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve\\ncessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual\\nbehavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive\\nmodels from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this\\napplication is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify\\nsmoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning\\nmethods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary\\neffectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning\\nprediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The\\nUniversity of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training\\nwill focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs,\\nwhich will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to\\nreduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of\\nless burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform\\nan automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring\\nindividual behavior and environmental context in real time.\",\"project_title\":\"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\nThe proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual\\nsmoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that\\nadapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If\\nsuccessful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet,\\nphysical activity, or other substance use disorders.\",\"spending_categories_desc\":null,\"agency_code\":\"NIH\",\"covid_response\":null,\"arra_funded\":\"N\",\"budget_start\":\"2022-12-01T12:12:00Z\",\"budget_end\":\"2023-11-30T12:11:00Z\",\"cfda_code\":\"279\",\"funding_mechanism\":\"Non-SBIR/STTR\",\"direct_cost_amt\":159611,\"indirect_cost_amt\":89382,\"project_detail_url\":\"https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10524021\",\"date_added\":\"2022-12-03T04:12:55Z\"},{\"appl_id\":10556378,\"subproject_id\":null,\"fiscal_year\":2023,\"project_num\":\"5P41GM135019-04\",\"project_serial_num\":\"GM135019\",\"organization\":{\"org_name\":\"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.\",\"city\":null,\"country\":null,\"org_city\":\"CAMBRIDGE\",\"org_country\":\"UNITED STATES\",\"org_state\":\"MA\",\"org_state_name\":null,\"dept_type\":null,\"fips_country_code\":null,\"org_duns\":[\"623544785\"],\"org_ueis\":[\"H5G9NWEFHXN4\"],\"primary_duns\":\"623544785\",\"primary_uei\":\"H5G9NWEFHXN4\",\"org_fips\":\"US\",\"org_ipf_code\":\"10021177\",\"org_zipcode\":\"021421027\",\"external_org_id\":10021177},\"award_type\":\"5\",\"activity_code\":\"P41\",\"award_amount\":1136551,\"is_active\":true,\"project_num_split\":{\"appl_type_code\":\"5\",\"activity_code\":\"P41\",\"ic_code\":\"GM\",\"serial_num\":\"135019\",\"support_year\":\"04\",\"full_support_year\":\"04\",\"suffix_code\":\"\"},\"principal_investigators\":[{\"profile_id\":9680244,\"first_name\":\"BETH\",\"middle_name\":\"\",\"last_name\":\"CIMINI\",\"is_contact_pi\":true,\"full_name\":\"BETH  CIMINI\",\"title\":\"COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGIST\"},{\"profile_id\":8876992,\"first_name\":\"Anne\",\"middle_name\":\"E.\",\"last_name\":\"Carpenter\",\"is_contact_pi\":false,\"full_name\":\"Anne E.

Quantitative image analysis has become an\\nindispensable tool for biologists using microscopy throughout basic biological and biomedical research.\\n Quantifying images is now a critical, widespread need as imaging experiments continue to grow in scale,\\nsize, dimensionality, scope, modality, and complexity. Many biologists are missing out on the quantitative\\nbioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and/or usable software for their needs, or lack of\\naccess to training. The Center brings together the Carpenter laboratory at the Broad Institute and the Eliceiri\\nlaboratory at the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and in doing so brings together the two most popular open\\nsource bioimage analysis projects, ImageJ (including ImageJ2 and FIJI) and CellProfiler. Through the\\ncollaborative development and dissemination of open source image analysis software, as well as training\\nevents and resources, the Center will empower thousands of researchers to apply advanced analytics in\\ninnovative ways to address new experimental areas.\\n Building on the team’s expertise developing algorithms and user­friendly software for use in biology under\\nreal­world conditions, the Center will focus on two Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects:\\ndeep learning­based image processing, and accessibility of image­processing algorithms for biologists. This\\nwork will not occur in isolation at the Center; rather, the Center will nucleate a larger community working on\\nthese two areas and serve as a catalyst and organizing force to create software and resources shared by all.\\n The Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) will serve a major role in driving the TR&D work: our teams are\\naccustomed to working deeply and iteratively on problems side by side and with frequent feedback from\\nbiologists. This will ensure that important cell biological problems drive the work of the Center. The DBPs\\nreflect tremendous variety in terms of biological questions, model systems, imaging modalities, and researcher\\nexpertise and will ensure robustness of our tools for the widest possible impact on the community. Continuing\\nthe teams’ track record with ImageJ and CellProfiler, two mature open source bioimage analysis software\\nprojects critical to the work of biologists worldwide, the Center will also assist and train biologists in applying\\nthe latest computational techniques to important biological problems involving images.\\n In short, the need for robust, accurate, and readily usable software is more urgent than ever. The Center for\\nOpen Bioimage Analysis will serve as a hub for pioneering new computational strategies for diverse biological\\nproblems, translating them into user­friendly software, further developing ImageJ and CellProfiler, and training\\nthe biological community to apply advanced software to important and diverse problems in cell biology.\",\"project_title\":\"Center for Open Bioimage Analysis\",\"phr_text\":\"Project Narrative\\nBiologists studying a huge variety of diseases and basic biological processes need software to measure cells,\\ntissues, and organisms in microscopy images.

Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG)\\nprogram is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire\\nhuman proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG\\n(“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at\\nunderstudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and\\nreagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on\\nunderstudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for\\nexpanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in\\norder to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update\\nand improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains,\\nspecifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web\\nprogramming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated\\nworkflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list.\\nThe KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major\\nbranches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and\\nInteractions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with\\nData Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central\\nKnowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its\\ncodebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data\\nand reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide\\ninformatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos.\\nParticularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek\\nfeedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities\\nthat will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing\\nFAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines.\\nThe KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of\\nthe Pharos system.

microbiome data analytics to aid in microbiome-based discovery sciences. The\\nmicrobiome, also called the second genome of the human, has received much attention in the past few years.\\nDue to its critical roles in human health and disease, the human microbiome has now been recognized as an\\nintegral part of the individualized medicine approach because it not only accounts for inter-individual variability\\nin all aspects of a disease but also represents a potentially modifiable factor that is amenable to targeting by\\ntherapeutics. Despite those fruitful and promising findings from microbiome studies, there is no consensus in\\nthe current field as how to appropriately analyze the data, let alone the optimality and efficiency issues that\\nhave yet to be addressed. Several challenges amount to this predicament, including complex experimental\\ndesigns of microbiome studies, an unknown interplay between microbiome and host, extremely sparsity and\\nhigh dimensionality of the data, phylogenetic relatedness of the microbial taxa, and compositional structure of\\nmicrobiome. As a result, although quite a few analytical methods and tools have been developed for\\nmicrobiome data analysis, several specific gaps exist in the methodological toolbox, hindering the advance of\\nmicrobiome-based biomedical sciences. To fill these gaps, this proposal aims to develop robust and powerful\\nquantitative methods and tools for microbiome data analysis. Specifically, Aim 1 focuses on developing robust\\nand powerful methods for differential abundance analysis in complex study designs. It will develop new\\nmethods to address zero-inflation, compositional effects and correlations in microbiome data. Aim 2 focuses on\\nstrategies to increase the power of microbiome-wide multiple testing. It proposes two new multiple testing\\nprocedures, which address confounders and phylogenetic relatedness, respectively. Aim 3 proposes to\\ndevelop compositional canonical correlation analysis methods for integrating microbiome data with other omics\\ndata. Specifically, it will develop an efficient and flexible framework for integrating heterogeneous omics data\\nwith microbiome data, accounting for compositional effects and phylogenetic relatedness. Aim 4 will develop\\nuser-friendly and efficient software packages so the community can benefit maximally from methodological and\\nscientific advances resulting from this application. The proposed methods will be evaluated using simulations,\\nand more importantly, applications to several ongoing microbiome studies in the Center of Individualized\\nMedicine at Mayo Clinic. The proposed quantitative methods and open-source software packages will\\ncontribute to microbiome biomarker discovery and microbiome-based mechanistic studies. All methods and\\ntools developed under this grant will be made available free of charge to interested researchers and the public.\",\"project_title\":\"Methods for microbiome compositional data\",\"phr_text\":\"Project Narrative\\nThe human microbiome provides additional perspective into health and disease.

One of the most\\nsignificant challenges facing organ transplantation is the limited supply of donor organs. As a result, there is\\nsubstantial clinical and public health interest in expanding the donor pool to include those organs that have\\nhistorically been discarded. Specifically, donors with positive bacterial cultures have been inconsistently\\nutilized, because there have been several reports of donors transmitting bacteria to their organ recipients via\\nthe allograft, causing donor-derived bacterial infections (DDBIs). DDBIs have been linked in limited data to\\npoor outcomes including vascular anastomosis dehiscence, overwhelming infection, and death. In some cases,\\nthe poor outcomes were attributed to the fact that the positive donor culture was not identified before transplant\\nand there was a delay in recipient diagnosis and treatment. Conversely, there have also been case series\\ndescribing safe transplantation of organs from donors with positive bacterial cultures. Thus, the true impact of\\ndonor bacterial infection or colonization on SOT recipients remains unclear.\\n In this study, we plan to address this knowledge gap by studying a large, multicenter cohort of SOT\\nrecipients and their donors. This cohort will be built upon an existing multicenter research infrastructure of\\ntransplant centers, as well as our unique research collaboration with the local organ procurement organization,\\nwhich coordinates transplantations in our region. In addition, we will be able to collect bacterial isolates from\\ndonors and recipients at our large transplant center in order to perform molecular testing. Specifically, we plan\\nto: (AIM 1) Determine the risk factors associated with acquiring a DDBI in SOT recipients; (Secondary AIM 1)\\nCompare whole genome sequencing (WGS) versus phenotypic characterization to define DDBI in a\\nsubpopulation of SOT recipients; (AIM 2) Determine the association between positive donor bacterial cultures\\nand time to (a) first bacterial infection and (b) graft failure or death; (AIM 3) Determine the predictors of positive\\ndonor cultures identified after organ transplantation.\\n The results of this study will be important for the field of transplantation as it wrestles with how to safely\\nexpand the donor pool. The aims are combined with a robust training plan that includes formal education in\\nbiostatistics and epidemiology, the development of advanced analytic skills for clinical and genome data,\\nformal benchmarks for progress including presentation at seminars and international conferences, and\\nextensive research experience under the guidance of an expert mentoring and advisory team.

SUMMARY\\n“Metabolomics” largely consists of metabolic profiling, which is the process of identification and quantification of\\na large number of metabolites of many different biochemical classes, from diverse biological samples, including\\ncells, culture media, tissue and biofluids. However, to understand the metabolic underpinning of diseases such\\nas cancer, biochemical mechanism(s) must be elucidated, in which case it is necessary to introduce appropriate\\nstable isotope tracers. Although this greatly increases the number of analytes to be quantified, it also enables\\nthe retrieval of much more biologically relevant information. This Stable Isotope Resolved Metabolomics (SIRM)\\napproach is a unique specialty of the Metabolism Core, led by PIs with over 40 years of combined expertise in\\nSIRM. The goals of the Metabolism Core are to provide services for a wide coverage of the metabolome with\\nisotopomer and isotopologue analysis, and high throughput protein analysis. To achieve this, we make use of\\nfour major analytical platforms, namely (1) high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), (2) ultra-high\\nresolution Fourier-transform mass spectrometry (UHR-FTMS), with or without chromatography, (3) ultra-trace\\nelemental analyses by inductively-coupled plasma MS (ICPMS), and (4) Reverse Phase Protein Arrays (RPPA).\\nThe Metabolism Core personnel will advise on analytical methods and SIRM-based experimental design with\\ndevelopment of additional techniques to address specific issues of identification and quantification and biological\\ninterpretation relevant to the COBRE Projects. Because experimental design and sample preparation are integral\\nto the data acquisition and interpretation, the Metabolism Core provides expertise in these and informatics\\nrelevant to the SIRM approach. These goals will be achieved according to the following Specific Aims. Specific\\nAim 1. To provide access and expertise across a wide range of NMR, MS and RPPA technologies to\\ninvestigators. Specific Aim 2. To provide experimental design, sample processing, and support to the\\ninvestigators for data reduction, metabolic pathway, and biochemical mechanism analyses. Specific Aim\\n3. To develop and implement new methods to enhance metabolic capabilities relevant to the COBRE\\nProjects. This Core will support the young investigators by providing advanced analytical technologies and\\nexpertise in the metabolic requirements for cancer development and behavior.\",\"project_title\":\"Metabolism

vast majority of smoking quit attempts\\nfail. Numerous conceptual models, as well as a large body of empirical evidence, underscore that\\naffect is a potent determinant of smoking lapse. Unfortunately, very little is known about how\\nthe constellation and temporal dynamics of distinct emotions and other factors play out in real\\ntime in the real world to influence lapse risk. This lack of knowledge severely hampers both our\\nconceptual models and our ability to optimally intervene. Thus, the overarching objectives of\\nthis research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of\\ndistinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation\\nnecessary to develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk\\nbehaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. The proposed research directly\\naddresses several objectives from the PAR including the influence of distinct emotions and\\ntheir time course on cancer risk behaviors, whether the role of distinct emotions is altered by\\nthe presence of other emotions (e.g., “blended” emotional states), and how the influence of\\naffective experience is modified by context. The proposed longitudinal cohort study among 300\\nsmokers attempting to quit is guided by a conceptual framework grounded in affective science\\nand conceptual models of self-regulation and addiction. Participants will be followed from 1\\nweek prior to their quit date through 6 months post-quit date. They will be assessed from 1 week\\npre-quit date through 2 weeks post-quit date using AutoSense, geographic positioning system\\n(GPS), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). AutoSense, GPS, and EMA collect real\\ntime data in natural environments, communicate wirelessly with each other, and data are\\nprocessed in real time on a smartphone. AutoSense detects specific behavioral and physiologic\\n“signatures” of smoking (the primary outcome) and self regulatory capacity (an intermediate\\noutcome; assessed using high frequency heart rate variability) in real time. GPS real time spatial\\ntracking will be linked with spatially and temporally relevant characteristics of the environment\\nusing geographic information system (GIS) data.

Quantitative image analysis has become an\\nindispensable tool for biologists using microscopy throughout basic biological and biomedical research.\\n Quantifying images is now a critical, widespread need as imaging experiments continue to grow in scale,\\nsize, dimensionality, scope, modality, and complexity. Many biologists are missing out on the quantitative\\nbioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and/or usable software for their needs, or lack of\\naccess to training. The Center brings together the Carpenter laboratory at the Broad Institute and the Eliceiri\\nlaboratory at the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and in doing so brings together the two most popular open\\nsource bioimage analysis projects, ImageJ (including ImageJ2 and FIJI) and CellProfiler. Through the\\ncollaborative development and dissemination of open source image analysis software, as well as training\\nevents and resources, the Center will empower thousands of researchers to apply advanced analytics in\\ninnovative ways to address new experimental areas.\\n Building on the team’s expertise developing algorithms and user­friendly software for use in biology under\\nreal­world conditions, the Center will focus on two Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects:\\ndeep learning­based image processing, and accessibility of image­processing algorithms for biologists. This\\nwork will not occur in isolation at the Center; rather, the Center will nucleate a larger community working on\\nthese two areas and serve as a catalyst and organizing force to create software and resources shared by all.\\n The Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) will serve a major role in driving the TR&D work: our teams are\\naccustomed to working deeply and iteratively on problems side by side and with frequent feedback from\\nbiologists. This will ensure that important cell biological problems drive the work of the Center. The DBPs\\nreflect tremendous variety in terms of biological questions, model systems, imaging modalities, and researcher\\nexpertise and will ensure robustness of our tools for the widest possible impact on the community. Continuing\\nthe teams’ track record with ImageJ and CellProfiler, two mature open source bioimage analysis software\\nprojects critical to the work of biologists worldwide, the Center will also assist and train biologists in applying\\nthe latest computational techniques to important biological problems involving images.\\n In short, the need for robust, accurate, and readily usable software is more urgent than ever. The Center for\\nOpen Bioimage Analysis will serve as a hub for pioneering new computational strategies for diverse biological\\nproblems, translating them into user­friendly software, further developing ImageJ and CellProfiler, and training\\nthe biological community to apply advanced software to important and diverse problems in cell biology.\",\"project_title\":\"Center for Open Bioimage Analysis\",\"phr_text\":\"Project Narrative\\nBiologists studying a huge variety of diseases and basic biological processes need software to measure cells,\\ntissues, and organisms in microscopy images.

major functions. First, it will provide administrative support\\nand intellectual enrichment for the investigators in this Program. Due to the fact that the Program includes\\nfive senior investigators from three institutions (UCSD, Salk, U Colorado), each in a different department,\\nCore A will be essential to integrate the disparate administrative hierarchies. Additionally three different\\nvertebrate species will be used for this work (human, mouse, frog), with the need to move animals between\\ninstitutions. Because of this, and because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the Program, a central\\nAdministrative Core is essential. The Core will work closely with the administration of the three partner\\ninstitutions, as well as administrators, business managers, and scientists in each department involved. The\\nAdministrative Core will: 1] Provide and encourage intellectual collaboration between members of the\\nProgram Project, Internal and External Advisory Panels, university faculty who are not members of the\\nProject, and outside consultants. 2] Assist individual PIs in budgeting as well as coordinating travel,\\npurchasing, meetings, and seminars. The Core will achieve these objectives in several ways: 1] We will\\nsupport a Slack instant messaging/video portal for routine programmatic issues. 2] We will have monthly\\ntwo-hour seminars for all Program members in this program via video conference. 3] We will have\\nsemiannual review by the Internal Advisory Group, and biennial Retreats by the External Advisory Group,\\nwith presentation by each PI. We will also have the Directors of Core B and C present new data, analytical\\ntechniques, and technological innovations, especially in the rapidly moving fields of genomics,\\nepigenomics, and bioinformatics. Seminars will average 10-12 per year, with each Project or Core\\npresenting 2-3 times per year. Internal and External Advisors are selected to advise each project\\nspecifically and will work directly with his/her PI regarding their progress, to suggest possible new directions\\nfor both the individual Projects, and potentially the overall Program. In addition, we propose to have two\\nwhole day symposia during Year 2 and Year 4, overlapping with the External Advisory Group meetings, in\\nwhich will invite scientists whose work is on the same aspect of the research of each project. During these\\nsymposia, each of the PI’s will present their progress over the preceding two years in the outside experts\\nwill be asked to critically evaluate progress of each

Summary/Abstract: Trace Elements\\nThe chemistry of inorganic elements is linked inextricably with the study of cancer. This is especially true for\\nour catchment area, given the high level of inorganic element exposures typical of “the Granite State”. Whether\\nstudying known carcinogens, such as arsenic, the potential antagonistic effects of elements, such as selenium,\\nor the therapeutic uses of platinum or iron nanoparticles, there is a clear need for both routine and advanced\\ntrace element analytical methods to support NCCC research. The Trace Elements (TE) Shared Resource\\nprovides access to low-level inorganic elemental analysis to all four research programs within the Cancer\\nCenter. TE uses state-of-the-art ICP-MS instruments to quantify multiple elements and, when coupled with\\nchromatography, multiple contaminant compounds (species) in a variety of biological and environmental\\nmedia. Cutting-edge ICP-MS instrumentation (e.g., triple-quadrupole ICP-QQQ) provides rapid, interference-\\nfree analysis of established and emerging contaminants and macro- and micro-nutrient elements. The breadth\\nof sample types handled by TE spans water, soil, sediment, invertebrates, fish and animal tissues and organs,\\ncell lysates, human hair, toenail, blood, urine, placenta, foodstuffs, and beverages. The ability to handle such a\\nbroad array of sample types is a unique feature of TE. In some cases, the sample mass available for analysis\\nis <10 mg, and methods often are adapted to account for small sample masses on a case-by-case basis.\\nAnalytical data must be collected according to accepted protocols for sample preparation, analysis, and quality\\ncontrol. TE has established protocols and a Quality Assurance program, uses methods based on those of the\\nCDC, FDA, EPA, and USGS; and participates in national and international proficiency testing programs to\\nensure accurate, precise, and defensible data. TE has very strong links to the Cancer Population Sciences\\n(CPS) Program. TE is an internationally-recognized center for low-level analysis of chemical elements and\\ntheir compounds in biological tissues. TE has provided services for 27 other US academic institutions over the\\npast funding cycle and fulfills a unique niche in providing state-of-the-art analytical services in trace elemental\\nanalysis. Over the last funding cycle, TE has run 6,721 samples for 12 NCCC Members from all 4 NCCC\\nPrograms (CPS [1], CBT [1], ICI [2], and TEC [8]). Funded NCCC Members have represented 15% (10) of\\nTotal Users, and we are requesting only 3% of the Total TE Budget from CCSG support. One focus of the CPS\\nProgram is early life exposure to arsenic, and TE is integral to the determination and speciation of arsenic for\\nthis project. This work has directly informed state and national public health policy. For example, the US FDA\\nannounced a proposed limit for inorganic arsenic in infant cereal of 100 ppb in 2016. For the TEC Program, TE\\nprovided a method for measuring iron nanoparticles in animal tissue. TE has contributed to CBT investigators\\nmonitoring the therapeutic effects of platinum. TE is demonstrably an essential, efficient and high-impact\\nresource that continues to play a pivotal role in NCCC research.\",\"project_title\":\"Trace Elements

of US children. Identification\\nof underlying causes can lead to primary and secondary prevention efforts. Substantial evidence\\nsupports contribution of both genes and environment, particularly prenatal exposures.\\nProspective studies, with exposure information collected during pregnancy, prior to symptom\\nonset, are sorely needed although prospective studies in the general population are not feasible,\\ncost effective, or efficient for ASD. The enriched-familial-risk design, which capitalizes on the\\nsubstantial recurrence risk of both ASD and NDD among siblings of children with ASD, has been\\nemployed to achieve prospective data collection with reasonable outcome events. The Early\\nAutism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) study has helped to trailblaze this enriched risk\\ncohort approach. EARLI recruited and followed over 260 pregnant women who already had a\\nchild with ASD with multiple study visits, child assessments, biosampling, and home environment\\nsurveys over pregnancy and the first 3 years of life. While the total sample size was constrained;\\nthe value of EARLI is the depth of longitudinal data and molecular measurements across multiple\\ntissue types and early developmental windows. To date, over 9.4 billion data points have been\\ngenerated across multiple phenotypes, tissues, exposures, and -omic measures. The current\\nproposal seeks to maintain and enrich this valuable study to fully realize its impact on\\nenvironmental health. The goals are to: 1. Maintain and extend the EARLI Biosample Repository\\nthrough support of the storage and retrieval efforts and addition and storage of shed baby teeth\\nthat will enable longitudinal prenatal exposure measures across a growing array of toxicant\\nexposures. 2. Measure frequency and patterns of emerging co-occurring conditions at school age\\nto better characterize phenotypes across co-occurring NDDs and quantitative traits. 3.\\nCharacterize variability of heavy metals measurement across timing, family members, and\\nmatrices including maternal blood and urine and shed baby teeth. 4. Develop and apply methods\\nfor phenotype and for exposure harmonization using latent constructs, enabling within and cross-\\ncohort investigations; 5. Migrate, enhance, and increase the reproducibility of EARLI research\\ndata to enable data sharing.

model-based reconstruction (MBR) and deep learning (DL) reconstruction have\\n 3 sparked tremendous research interest in recent years. Compared to traditional linear approaches, the nonline-\\n 4 arity of these algorithm transcends traditional signal-to-noise requirement and offer flexibility to draw information\\n 5 from a variety of sources (e.g., statistical model, prior image, dictionary, training data). MBR has enabled numer-\\n 6 ous advancements including low-dose CT and advanced scanning protocols. Deep learning algorithms are rap-\\n 7 idly emerging and have demonstrated superior dose vs. image quality tradeoffs in research settings. However,\\n 8 widespread clinical adoption of nonlinear algorithms has been impeded by the lack of a lack of systematic, quan-\\n 9 titative methods for performance analysis. Nonlinear methods come with numerous dependencies on the imag-\\n10 ing techniques, the imaging target, and the prior information, and the data itself. The relationship between these\\n11 dependencies and image quality is often opaque. Furthermore, improper selection of algorithmic parameters can\\n12 lead to erroneous features (e.g., smaller lesions, texture) in the reconstruction. Therefore, methods to quantify\\n13 and predict performance permit efficient and quantifiable performance evaluation to provide the robust control\\n14 and understanding of imaging output necessary for reliable clinical application and regulatory oversight.\\n15 We propose to establish a robust, predictive framework for performance assessment and optimization that can\\n16 be generalized to any reconstruction method. We quantify performance in turns of the perturbation response and\\n17 covariance as a function of imaging techniques, system configurations, patient anatomy, and, importantly, the\\n18 perturbation itself. The perturbation response quantifies the appearance (e.g., biases, blurs, distortions), and,\\n19 together with the covariance, allows the computation of more complex metrics such as task-based performance\\n20 and radiomic measures including size, shape, and texture information. We illustrate utility of the approach in lung\\n21 imaging with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop a lesion library and generate perturbations encom-\\n22 passing clinically relevant features. We will extract lesions from public databases and develop methods lesion\\n23 emulation in for realistic CT simulation and physical data via 3D printing technology. Aim 2: Develop a gener-\\n24 alized prediction framework for perturbation response and covariance. Using analytical and neural network\\n25 modeling, we will establish a framework that predicts perturbation response and covariance across imaging\\n26 scenarios for classes of algorithms with increasing data-dependence including MBR with a Huber penalty, MBR\\n27 with dictionary regularization, and a deep learning reconstructor. Aim 3: Develop assessment and optimiza-\\n28 tion strategies to drive robust, low dose lung screening CT methods. We will optimize and adapt nonlinear\\n29 algorithms and protocols for lung cancer screening to achieve faithful representations of clinical features. This\\n30 work has the potential to drive much-needed quantitative assessment standards that directly relate image quality\\n31 to diagnostic performance and optimal strategies for robust, reliable clinical deployment of nonlinear algorithms.\\n32\",\"project_title\":\"Nonlinear performance analysis and prediction for robust low dose lung CT\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\nMajor research efforts have been devoted to the development of nonlinear reconstruction algorithms – from\\nmodel-based reconstruction to deep learning, these algorithms have demonstrated many advantages such as\\nimproved image quality, reduced radiation dose, and additional diagnostic information that are not achievable\\nwith traditional linear reconstructions.

RESOURCE (P&MSR)\\nThe Proteomics and Metabolomics Shared Resource (P&MSR) consists of the Fred Hutch (FH)-based\\nProteomics Facility and the University of Washington South Lake Union (UW-SLU) Metabolomics Facility. The\\nP&MSR Proteomics Facility was formed in 2002 and has been under the direction of Dr. Phil Gafken since its\\ninception. The P&MSR Metabolomics Facility was formed in 2013 and has been under the direction of Dr.\\nDaniel Raftery. The mission of the P&MSR is (1) to provide high-quality, cost-effective, and reliable service in a\\ntimely manner for proteomics and metabolomics experiments; (2) to develop and implement new omics\\nexperiments, assays, and tools to uncover the molecular details influencing cancer biology; and (3) to support\\nthe development of translatable and clinical tests. The P&MSR operates and maintains chromatography, mass\\nspectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance instruments and offers services such as experimental design\\nand consultation, sample preparation and chromatography, protein or metabolite identification and\\nquantification, protein modification characterization, targeted protein or metabolite quantification, metabolic flux\\nanalysis, and data analysis and informatics support. New technologies and services are continually being\\nevaluated based on feedback from Consortium members. Over the next granting period, areas of interest that\\nwill be investigated include the analysis of major histocompatibility complex peptides to support cancer\\nimmunology and immunotherapy research. For metabolomics we will add to our over 20 current assays by\\nexpanding our capabilities to measure metabolic flux, provide the capability to investigate real-time metabolism\\nstudies using stable isotope tracers, and develop higher throughput global profiling assays to support research\\nin cancer biology. With well-established operation policies, Consortium users have cost-effective, reliable, and\\nimmediate access to the P&MSR. The research supported by the P&MSR demonstrates that it is an important\\npart of the critical Shared Resources infrastructure needed to support the Fred Hutch/University of Washington\\nCancer Consortium.\",\"project_title\":\"Shared Resource: Proteomics & Metabolomics\",\"phr_text\":\"Not applicable to P30 CCSG as stated in the FOA PAR-17-095.\",\"spending_categories_desc\":null,\"agency_code\":\"NIH\",\"covid_response\":null,\"arra_funded\":\"N\",\"budget_start\":\"2023-01-01T12:01:00Z\",\"budget_end\":\"2023-12-31T12:12:00Z\",\"cfda_code\":null,\"funding_mechanism\":\"Research Centers\",\"direct_cost_amt\":259880,\"indirect_cost_amt\":114896,\"project_detail_url\":\"https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10636774\",\"date_added\":\"2023-01-07T04:01:46Z\"},{\"appl_id\":10543557,\"subproject_id\":null,\"fiscal_year\":2023,\"project_num\":\"5R01NS119622-02\",\"project_serial_num\":\"NS119622\",\"organization\":{\"org_name\":\"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS\",\"city\":null,\"country\":null,\"org_city\":\"DAVIS\",\"org_country\":\"UNITED STATES\",\"org_state\":\"CA\",\"org_state_name\":null,\"dept_type\":\"INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE\",\"fips_country_code\":null,\"org_duns\":[\"047120084\"],\"org_ueis\":[\"TX2DAGQPENZ5\"],\"primary_duns\":\"047120084\",\"primary_uei\":\"TX2DAGQPENZ5\",\"org_fips\":\"US\",\"org_ipf_code\":\"577503\",\"org_zipcode\":\"956186153\",\"external_org_id\":577503},\"award_type\":\"5\",\"activity_code\":\"R01\",\"award_amount\":499998,\"is_active\":true,\"project_num_split\":{\"appl_type_code\":\"5\",\"activity_code\":\"R01\",\"ic_code\":\"NS\",\"serial_num\":\"119622\",\"support_year\":\"02\",\"full_support_year\":\"02\",\"suffix_code\":\"\"},\"principal_investigators\":[{\"profile_id\":1929878,\"first_name\":\"JONATHAN\",\"middle_name\":\"M\",\"last_name\":\"KIMMELMAN\",\"is_contact_pi\":false,\"full_name\":\"JONATHAN M KIMMELMAN\",\"title\":\"\"},{\"profile_id\":6968966,\"first_name\":\"Mark\",\"middle_name\":\"\",\"last_name\":\"Yarborough\",\"is_contact_pi\":true,\"full_name\":\"Mark  Yarborough\",\"title\":\"DEAN'S PROFESSOR OF BIOETHICS\"}],\"contact_pi_name\":\"YARBOROUGH, MARK \",\"program_officers\":[{\"first_name\":\"ADAM\",\"middle_name\":\"L.\",\"last_name\":\"HARTMAN\",\"full_name\":\"ADAM L.

IRBs must carefully assess the scientific information supporting the assessment of\\npotential risks and benefits in order to meet these conditions. Several hurdles hinder such assessment. While\\nthe FDA carefully vets preclinical safety data that relate to Phase 1 trials, the same is not true for the preclinical\\nefficacy data needed to support the potential for benefit. Further, IRBs receive no specific guidance regarding\\nwhat to look for in preclinical efficacy data or how they should vet scientific claims made about Phase 1\\nmodalities. This lack of guidance is disconcerting given extensive research documenting characteristics of\\nmany preclinical efficacy studies that make it difficult to make reliable inferences about whether a new\\ntreatment modality might eventually be capable of demonstrating clinical efficacy. Such inferences are\\nespecially challenging when it comes to preclinical efficacy studies that employ novel research techniques like\\nCRISPR-Cas9 and brain organoids. Knowing what inferences about potential efficacy can reliably be made\\nabout new treatment modalities employing novel preclinical tools will be the primary focus of our project. These\\nare the very inferences that are required if IRBs are to be able to determine that there is a reasonable ratio\\nbetween benefits and risks in Phase 1 trials employing new promissory technologies. In this challenging\\nsetting, IRBs could benefit from a structured approach to risk/benefit assessments. This project is designed to\\ndevelop and pilot such an approach. To do this, we will conduct quantitative and qualitative research to learn\\nabout current strengths and weaknesses in IRB review of Phase 1 studies. We will complete a national survey\\nof IRB chairs. Then we will conduct 3 sets of semi-structured interviews with: (a) past Phase 1 trial\\ninvestigators, (b) IRB members who review Phase 1 trial applications, and (c) past participants or their legal\\nrepresentatives of Phase 1 trials. We will use these findings to refine an existing conceptual framework for\\nassessing the quality and reliability of efficacy data in preclinical studies. From this refined conceptual\\nframework, we will develop IRB and investigator checklists designed to (a) promote highly-structured weighing\\nof potential benefits and risks by IRBs in Phase 1 trials and (b) assist Phase 1 investigators to submit more\\nethically robust Phase 1 trial applications. We will also develop a novel data analytics and decision-support\\ninteractive software platform to help Phase 1 investigators and IRB members evaluate the evidentiary context\\nsurrounding a given Phase 1 trial. These decision aids will also be used to identify critical disclosures about\\npotential risks and benefits to Phase 1 trial research candidates. To see if our decision aids might produce\\nthese desired benefits, in the final year of our project we will pilot them with Phase 1 investigators and IRB\\nmembers.\",\"project_title\":\"The RATIOS Study: Risk/benefit AssessmenT by IRB review of Phase One Studies\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\nPhase 1 trials are a critical first step in the search for new treatments and cures for serious neurological\\ndiseases. In order to conduct these studies ethically, research ethics committees must determine both that the\\nrisks of the trials are reasonable in relation to their potential benefits and that research candidates are given\\nthe key information they need in order to understand the potential risks and benefits in such a trial. These\\ncommittees currently are not provided with instructions from the Department of Health and Human Services for\\ndetermining whether there is a reasonable ratio between risks and benefits or what counts as the key\\ninformation about them that need to be disclosed to research candidates.

research and clinical diagnosis by introducing a new redox trapping formulation for\\npreservation of blood specimens. The new formulation is anticipated: 1) to prevent artifactual oxidation and loss\\nof specimen integrity during storage, 2) to enable studies of redox metabolism which underlines the dysregulated\\nimmunometabolic response in sepsis, and 3) to improve analysis of differentiating redox molecular markers\\nassociated with demographic features (age, gender and racial ethnicity). Our combined expertise of redox\\nbiochemistry and innovation in patented redox chemical reagents, sepsis mechanisms, trial design and clinical\\nexpertise will be applied first to validate the new redox trapping formulation (R21 Phase) and then to scale-up\\nby deploying this for collection of blood specimens at sites participating in the EMbedded Precision in Acute Care\\nTrials (EMPACT) Network (R33 Phase). This is a newly formed network of premier critical care clinical trials sites\\ndesigned to conduct precision clinical trials and discovery research in sepsis. Successful accomplishment of our\\naims will improve staging of septic patients and clinical precision research for discovery of new therapeutic\\ntargets for treatment of sepsis. More specifically, during the R21 Phase we will investigate the compatibility of\\nthe new redox formulation with high-end mass spectrometry and single cell technologies to evaluate its\\nperformance for measurement of redox and other biomarkers. The new formulation will be compared with current\\nstandard of care procedures for blood collection for clinical and research purposes (gold standard). To further\\nvalidate this formula in sepsis patients, we will then evaluate its effects on standard clinical lab tests in a pilot\\nstudy using prospectively collected paired single timepoint samples from critically ill patients with sepsis. We will\\nfurther determine the advantage of redox trapping formulation by linking the measurements to physiologic and\\noutcome data collected passively through the Wake Forest Critical Care Data Analytic Platform. Upon\\naccomplishment of key metrics at the completion of R21 Phase, we will work with the EMPACT Network in the\\nR33 Phase to collect blood specimens from 150 patients at 3 timepoints across the continuum of their disease\\nprogression using the standard methods and the new redox formulation. Analysis using high-end omics\\ntechnologies will produce information-rich and redox-specific datasets, which will be integrated using\\nbioinformatics approaches and linked to clinical data captured passively via the EMPACT data warehouse to\\ngenerate new hypotheses for sepsis research. Lastly, we include a plan to share cryopreserved specimens,\\nclinical and molecular data with investigators at the institution to support discovery or hypothesis-driven research\\nthrough pilot mechanisms under the Center for Redox Biology and Medicine and Critical Illness, Injury and\\nResearch Recovery Research Center directed by MPIs Furdui and Files, respectively, and with outside\\ninvestigators via EMPACT.\",\"project_title\":\"Redox Trapping for Biospecimen Preservation and Innovation in Sepsis Care\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\nSepsis is estimated to cause 20% of deaths worldwide, though we have a poor understanding of sepsis and no\\neffective treatments. Our understanding of sepsis is limited by both improper collection of blood samples and\\nambiguous clinical phenotyping. This project addresses both of these problems by 1) improving the quality of\\nblood collected from sepsis patients that prevents artifactual oxidation during specimen collection and storage,\\nand 2) linking molecular data including those associated with redox immunometabolism to clinical sepsis\\nphenotypes. These blood samples, molecular and clinical data will provide researchers with new tools to find\\neffective treatments for sepsis.\",\"spending_categories_desc\":null,\"agency_code\":\"NIH\",\"covid_response\":null,\"arra_funded\":\"N\",\"budget_start\":\"2023-01-01T12:01:00Z\",\"budget_end\":\"2023-12-31T12:12:00Z\",\"cfda_code\":\"859\",\"funding_mechanism\":\"Non-SBIR/STTR\",\"direct_cost_amt\":132038,\"indirect_cost_amt\":72621,\"project_detail_url\":\"https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10541870\",\"date_added\":\"2023-01-07T04:01:46Z\"},{\"appl_id\":10556382,\"subproject_id\":\"8660\",\"fiscal_year\":2023,\"project_num\":\"5P41GM135019-04\",\"project_serial_num\":\"GM135019\",\"organization\":{\"org_name\":\"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.\",\"city\":null,\"country\":null,\"org_city\":\"CAMBRIDGE\",\"org_country\":\"UNITED STATES\",\"org_state\":\"MA\",\"org_state_name\":null,\"dept_type\":null,\"fips_country_code\":null,\"org_duns\":[\"623544785\"],\"org_ueis\":[\"H5G9NWEFHXN4\"],\"primary_duns\":\"623544785\",\"primary_uei\":\"H5G9NWEFHXN4\",\"org_fips\":\"US\",\"org_ipf_code\":\"10021177\",\"org_zipcode\":\"021421027\",\"external_org_id\":10021177},\"award_type\":\"5\",\"activity_code\":\"P41\",\"award_amount\":322548,\"is_active\":true,\"project_num_split\":{\"appl_type_code\":\"5\",\"activity_code\":\"P41\",\"ic_code\":\"GM\",\"serial_num\":\"135019\",\"support_year\":\"04\",\"full_support_year\":\"04\",\"suffix_code\":\"\"},\"principal_investigators\":[{\"profile_id\":8876992,\"first_name\":\"Anne\",\"middle_name\":\"E.\",\"last_name\":\"Carpenter\",\"is_contact_pi\":true,\"full_name\":\"Anne E.

for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve the cell biology community’s growing need for\\nsophisticated software for light microscopy image analysis. Quantitative image analysis has become an\\nindispensable tool for biologists using microscopy throughout basic biological and biomedical research.\\n Quantifying images is now a critical, widespread need as imaging experiments continue to grow in scale,\\nsize, dimensionality, scope, modality, and complexity. Many biologists are missing out on the quantitative\\nbioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and/or usable software for their needs, or lack of\\naccess to training. The Center brings together the Carpenter laboratory at the Broad Institute and the Eliceiri\\nlaboratory at the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and in doing so brings together the two most popular open\\nsource bioimage analysis projects, ImageJ (including ImageJ2 and FIJI) and CellProfiler. Through the\\ncollaborative development and dissemination of open source image analysis software, as well as training\\nevents and resources, the Center will empower thousands of researchers to apply advanced analytics in\\ninnovative ways to address new experimental areas.\\n Building on the team’s expertise developing algorithms and user­friendly software for use in biology under\\nreal­world conditions, the Center will focus on two Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects:\\ndeep learning­based image processing, and accessibility of image­processing algorithms for biologists. This\\nwork will not occur in isolation at the Center; rather, the Center will nucleate a larger community working on\\nthese two areas and serve as a catalyst and organizing force to create software and resources shared by all.\\n The Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) will serve a major role in driving the TR&D work: our teams are\\naccustomed to working deeply and iteratively on problems side by side and with frequent feedback from\\nbiologists. This will ensure that important cell biological problems drive the work of the Center. The DBPs\\nreflect tremendous variety in terms of biological questions, model systems, imaging modalities, and researcher\\nexpertise and will ensure robustness of our tools for the widest possible impact on the community. Continuing\\nthe teams’ track record with ImageJ and CellProfiler, two mature open source bioimage analysis software\\nprojects critical to the work of biologists worldwide, the Center will also assist and train biologists in applying\\nthe latest computational techniques to important biological problems involving images.\\n In short, the need for robust, accurate, and readily usable software is more urgent than ever. The Center for\\nOpen Bioimage Analysis will serve as a hub for pioneering new computational strategies for diverse biological\\nproblems, translating them into user­friendly software, further developing ImageJ and CellProfiler, and training\\nthe biological community to apply advanced software to important and diverse problems in cell biology.\",\"project_title\":\"Center for Open Bioimage Analysis\",\"phr_text\":\"Project Narrative\\nBiologists studying a huge variety of diseases and basic biological processes need software to measure cells,\\ntissues, and organisms in microscopy images.

ANALYSIS CORE\\n The Gene and Chromatin Analysis Core provides the technical and bioinformatics infrastructure to\\noptimally mine the large amount of genome-wide gene expression and chromatin data that are generated from\\nthe PPG’s work. PPG investigators lead the field in several aspects of genome-wide analyses, including\\npioneering these approaches to specific cell types in brain, which offers several technical challenges. We have\\noptimized methods for several next generation sequencing approaches, including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-\\nseq, HiC, and whole genome bisulfite sequencing, among others, for rodent and human brain, the latter\\noffering an additional set of unique technical challenges. These approaches are being used increasingly to\\nstudy individual cell types within a given brain reward region, in both rodent and human. The Core has\\nestablished expertise in analyzing the highly complex datasets obtained, and will work on further improving the\\ntools available. All of the genome-wide data generated by our PPG are analyzed by this Core. In parallel, the\\nCore runs routine genome-wide assays on defined animal models, with the Animal Models Core, and thereby\\nprovides a foundation for the more specific and sophisticated measures in the individual Projects. Indeed, each\\nProject focuses on genes that are among the most robustly regulated across rodent addiction models and\\nhuman substance use disorders. As well, the Core pilots novel experimental technologies; an example is our\\nability to target single chromatin modifications to a single gene within a single brain region and cell type in vivo,\\nthus providing an unparalleled level of proof to establish transcriptional mechanisms of addiction. By\\nconsolidating the analytical work and routine genome-wide analyses within a centralized Core, we ensure\\nrigorous control over the data and facilitate comparisons of experimental findings across the four individual\\nProjects. This consolidation also makes financial sense, since we concentrate and maximize efficient use of\\nour expertise. Finally, the Core is responsible, with the Administrative Core, in maintaining a platform for\\nsharing our genome-wide datasets and analytical tools across the PPG’s laboratories as well as with the\\nscientific community and lay public at large.\",\"project_title\":\"Gene and Chromatin Analysis

toxic protein known to science. Although serious Adverse Events (AEs) are rare, their\\nimportance is recognized by the Black Box warning included in the labeling for all FDA-approved BoNT/A1\\nproducts. During a recent 3-year period FDA received 13,087 AE reports specifically described as “overdose”,\\nprimarily associated with therapeutic indications. involving the treatment of large muscle groups (eg post-stroke\\nspasticity, cerebral palsy and cervical dystonia). No treatment is available for BoNT/A1-associated iatrogenic\\nAEs other than supportive care. The only available botulism therapeutic is an equine-derived antitoxin (BAT,\\nEmergent Biosolutions) that cannot access the intraneuronal toxin protease responsible for iatrogenic symptoms,\\nand is therefore of little use in treating AEs associated with BoNT/A1 overdose and off-target actions. We have\\ndeveloped a post-symptomatic antidote to BoNT/A1 intoxication with an intraneuronal mechanism of action,\\ndesignated B8C1ad. B8C1ad is produced by genetically fusing a single domain antibody (sdAb, B8) to a\\nrecombinant atoxic derivative of BoNT/C1 (C1ad for atoxic derivative) that acts as a molecular vehicle to deliver\\nthe B8 antibody to the neuronal cytoplasm where the BoNT/A1 toxic protease resides. The B8 antibody was\\nselected from a camelid VHH library for its potent inhibition of the BoNT/A1 protease. B8C1ad has been\\ndemonstrated to effectively rescue animals with systemic BoNT/A1 intoxication at times post-intoxication when\\nconventional antibodies are ineffective, because they cannot access the intra-neuronal BoNT/A1 LC protease.\\nThe safety and effectiveness of B8C1ad to reverse BoNT/A1 intoxication symptoms and rescue animals has\\nbeen published in three species, including non-human primates. We here propose establishing a model for\\nBoNT/A1 overdose via intramuscular administration of supratherapeutic doses, and developing B8C1ad as an\\nOrphan Drug to treat off-target iatrogenic AEs associated with the clinical use of BoNT/A1 pharmaceutical\\nproducts. Successful completion of the proposed studies will support assembly of a target product profile for\\nB8C1ad, which will be shared with FDA to request a Type C meeting for guidance on the regulatory pathway for\\nB8C1ad approval as an Orphan Drug to treat iatrogenic overdose associated with BoNT/A1 pharmaceuticals.\",\"project_title\":\"Development of B8C1ad as an Orphan Drug for Iatrogenic Botulism\",\"phr_text\":\"Project Narrative\\nBotulinum neurotoxin serotype A1 (BoNT/A1) has become an important therapeutic tool for multiple indications,\\ndespite being the most toxic protein known to science.

high-quality, safe care to Veterans. A learning health system, per the Institute\\nof Medicine, harnesses data and analytics to learn from every patient and feed the knowledge to clinicians to\\nimplement with high-reliability. Transforming the VA into a learning health system is vital to Veterans health,\\ngiven the wide variation in use of evidence-based practices and Veteran outcomes. The learning environments\\nin which clinical care is provided can impact these variations. Learning environments are the educational ap-\\nproaches (e.g., on-line v. unit-based trainings), cultural context, and settings in which teaching, and learning\\nhappen. Supportive learning environments, which are the ideal learning environment, engage employees\\nthrough team-based trainings, such as Crew Resource Management, that include communication and team-\\nwork skills and employ highly-reliable work practices (e.g., checklists). Healthcare teams need flexible training\\ntools that can be easily implemented using available resources to create supportive learning environments.\\nUntil this need is met, one-size fits all approaches will be the dominant educational method in healthcare.\\nSignificance/Impact: The proposed research is significant for its potential to provide teams tailored Crew Re-\\nsource Management tools to create supportive learning environments, resulting in enhanced employee en-\\ngagement, learning, and Veteran care and its contribution to implementation and learning health science.\\nInnovation: The proposed research is innovative in that it attempts to shift the current paradigm for learning\\nfrom standardized procedurally-focused educational methods that lack communication and teamwork content\\nto one that provides teams Crew Resource Management tools to change their culture toward learning to en-\\nhance Veteran care. We will partner with VA cardiac cath labs as a model learning health system for this work.\\nSpecific Aims: Aim 1: Assess how and why VA cath lab learning environments differ. Administer learn-\\ning environment surveys to the 81 VA cath labs, assess for changes over time and if learning environments\\nthat are highly supportive are associated with higher employee engagement and safety climate scores. Ob-\\nserve two consistently supportive and two non-supportive learning environments to understand the basis for\\ndiverse contexts. Aim 2: Adapt Crew Resource Management to the culture, work flow, and learning envi-\\nronments of cath labs. Engage advisory panel and stakeholders using nominal, small group technique to\\nachieve consensus on program design and toolkit components. Assess feasibility, appropriateness, acceptabil-\\nity of toolkit. Aim 3: Pilot test the Crew Resource Management-based toolkit at four cath labs over 1\\nyear. Test the feasibility of implementation and collection of evaluation (e.g., adoption, implementation, mainte-\\nnance) and outcome data (e.g., learning environment, teamwork, and error reporting). Using pre-post interven-\\ntion data, test the hypothesis that as learning environments become more supportive, there will be a positive\\ntrend in employee engagement, safety climate, and a negative trend in cath lab errors.\\nMethodology: We will use a mixed methods sequential explanatory design and partner with staff and leader-\\nship from the 81 VA cath labs for the proposed research.\\nNext Steps: The study findings will be the basis for future work to spread and scale up Crew Resource Man-\\nagement-based toolkits in diverse settings and populations and to study the impact on Veteran outcomes.\",\"project_title\":\"Building Supportive Learning Environments: Implementation Research in VA Cardiac Cath Labs\",\"phr_text\":\"This project is relevant to all aspects of VA healthcare for it will develop and evaluate a training toolkit to assist\\nhealthcare teams to change their culture toward learning to enhance Veteran care.

This will be achieved through studying unit-level learning environments, identifying high-\\nreliability practices that support a learning culture and using this knowledge to adapt a team training program to\\nthe culture and workflow of clinical units. We will develop and test a training toolkit to empower teams to de-\\nvelop their own culture of learning and a rigorous mixed methods evaluation that leads to valid, generalizable\\nlessons applicable across healthcare settings.

commonly used to treat pain but have serious side effects, including addiction,\\ndependence, and death from overdose. While there is a significant need for new non-addictive analgesics,\\nefforts to develop new pain medicines have met with limited success. In part, this failure is due to an\\noverreliance on evoked pain measures in preclinical models. Indeed, most preclinical models do not measure\\nspontaneous pain—the main symptom of chronic pain in humans. To increase translational relevance, the\\nMouse Grimace Scale (MGS) was developed to quantify characteristic facial expressions associated with\\nspontaneous pain. The MGS is reproducible across labs and was used to evaluate the efficacy of analgesics.\\nHowever, the MGS has not been widely adopted due to its high resource demands and low throughput. To\\novercome this limitation, we adapted a machine learning model to classify the presence or absence of pain\\nfrom mouse facial expressions. We called this model the automated Mouse Grimace Scale (aMGS). After\\ntraining, this model identified mice in pain with 94% accuracy, comparable to a highly-trained human. However,\\nour original “aMGS 1.0” is limited in several respects. It is only accurate at detecting facial grimacing in white-\\ncoated mice, and produces a binary assessment (“pain” vs. “no pain”) instead of a graded score. Moreover,\\naMGS 1.0 cannot dynamically determine pain status from full-motion videos. Additionally, we relied on an older\\npiece of software that does not consistently extract high-quality images of the mouse face. The aMGS 1.0 also\\nhas difficulty distinguishing between images of sleeping and grimacing mice. Finally, aMGS 1.0 suffers from a\\n“black box” problem inherent to most machine learning algorithms, in that we do not know what facial details it\\nuses to produce a pain assessment. Here we propose to overcome all of these limitations by developing\\na more sophisticated version of our automated pain classifier (aMGS 2.0). To achieve this goal we will: 1)\\nDevelop and validate a new open-source platform to classify (frame-by-frame) spontaneous pain intensity from\\nmouse facial expressions, using albino (white) mice and motion information. 2) Enhance the generality of\\naMGS 2.0 for use with black mice. And, 3) Develop a user-friendly web-based platform that operates on\\ncomputer-based and mobile devices. We will validate the utility of aMGS with three pain assays that produce\\ngrimaces in rodents—inflammatory pain, post-surgical (laparotomy) pain, and neuropathic pain. To increase\\nrigor and reproducibility, two pain assays will be performed and scored with aMGS 2.0 in an independent lab.\\nNumerous investigators in the pain field have expressed interest in using our proposed model.

In the first phase of this project, we concentrated on demonstrating the\\naccuracy and performance of these algorithms for the study of chronic diseases in which (1)\\nacquisition of new knowledge about the condition is slow (i.e., the disease is well understood, so\\nscientific discoveries are not being published at a rapid pace); and (2) the incidence and\\npresentation of the disease do not vary dramatically from place to place, and from person to\\nperson. In this competitive renewal, we propose to develop decentralized predictive models that\\nmeet all requirements for chronic diseases, but the methods are also applicable to rapidly evolving\\nacute conditions such as COVID-19. We propose new approaches to deal with sites that may be\\nmissing certain patient profiles or certain variables but can still participate in model learning,\\nevaluation and implementation. These new AI algorithms will permit supervised and unsupervised\\nlearning across institutions, using data from multiple modalities (e.g., imaging, genomes,\\nlaboratory tests), and will allow privacy-protecting record linkage.

the\\nneuroimaging field, particularly in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which has experienced an\\nexponential growth in recent years. FNs have allowed us to better understand extrinsic and intrinsic brain\\nproperties in various disease and healthy states, leading to better characterization of neuropsychiatric\\ndisorders. However, current fMRI analyses are constrained to the gray matter (GM) region of the brain and\\nfMRI data from the white matter (WM) region are often discarded, which makes up approximately 50% of the\\nbrain by volume. Many brain disorders have been associated with WM deficiencies, since WM is critical for the\\ntransmission of information to the GM cortical areas. Despite findings of blood-oxygen-level-dependent\\n(BOLD) signals in the WM, WM-FNs are yet to be fully characterized, and neither the mechanism by which\\nWM-FNs may affect GM-FNs, nor how WM-FNs are associated with phenotypic traits are known.\\nThe long-term goal of this project is to better understand the effect of WM-FNs on normal cognitive\\nfunctions of the human brain and apply fMRI data from various healthy and diseased populations for more\\nreliable diagnostics and monitoring. The rationale for this study is based on our preliminary studies which\\ninvestigated WM-FNs using the Human Connectome Project dataset. We found that WM-FNs are correlated\\nwith subregions of the corpus callosum, a critical WM region relaying information between the two cortical\\nhemispheres. Furthermore, we determined an overlap between the WM-FNs and tracts from diffusion tensor\\nimaging (DTI). In this study we will examine WM-FNs of the whole brain using resting fMRI data from two large\\nindependent cohorts. We hypothesize that the FN measures derived from WM will be similar to that of GM and\\nthe metrics can be used to reliably predict phenotypic traits. The hypothesis will be tested with the following\\nspecific aims: Aim1: To develop and evaluate the time-series, FC and FN characteristics of WM of the whole -\\nbrain; Aim 2: To investigate WM-phenotype associations and the predictability of phenotypes using WM-FNs;\\nand Aim 3: To develop and disseminate a WM-FN toolbox. To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the\\nfirst to examine the reliability and validity of WM-FNs in resting fMRI data, and its relation to brain function. The\\nproposed work holds significant contribution since it will facilitate the use of WM-FN methods for the\\nneuroimaging community, which currently lacks the necessary analytic tools to reliably characterize WM\\nfunction. This study will provide a strong foundation f or future clinical use of both WM-FNs and GM-FNs, to\\nunderstand brain function more comprehensively, in addition to facilitating the use of reliable and reproducible\\nWM-FC methods.\",\"project_title\":\"Functional Connectivity and Baseline Networks of the White Matter Brain: Development and Dissemination of Algorithms and Tools\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\nFunctional connectivity and functional networks of the brain’s cortical gray matter have allowed us to better\\nunderstand how different regions of the human brain are connected.

EoE is\\na chronic, allergen-mediated, inflammatory condition of the esophagus. As one of the most common cause of\\nupper gastrointestinal morbidity, it affects 1 out of 2000 individuals in the United States. Our understanding of\\nthe pathogenesis of EoE is incomplete and this has contributed towards burdensome approaches to treat EoE\\npatients. There is a critical unmet need to understand all factors related with development of EoE, including\\ndetermining the biochemical changes in the esophagus that leads to transformation of an unaffected\\nesophagus to an inflamed esophagus in EoE. As a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with clinical and research\\nfocus on EoE for more than a decade, the candidate proposes to fill this important knowledge gap by building\\non his published work through: 1) Validating the esophageal biochemical changes in EoE using Raman\\nspectroscopy (a uniquely suited, highly sensitive, laser-based technique) and machine learning, 2) Determining\\nthe correlation between the Raman peaks and the disease activity, and the operating characteristics of the key\\nRaman peaks in distinguishing EoE activity states, and 3) Determining if a combination of the baseline Raman,\\nhistologic, endoscopic, and clinical features can predict response to EoE therapy. By defining the key\\nesophageal biochemical alterations this study will offer novel insights into pathogenesis of EoE, and by\\nidentifying the baseline predictors of the treatment response it will lay a framework for personalized care of\\nEoE patients. This cutting-edge and clinically relevant research will be conducted in an intellectually stimulating\\nand supportive environment at the Vanderbilt University. Throughout the award period, the candidate will be\\nmentored by Dr. Anita Mahadevan-Jansen (primary mentor, expert in Raman Spectroscopy), Dr. Evan Dellon\\n(co-mentor, expert in EoE), and a team of exceptional mentors in pathology, allergic inflammation, biostatistics\\nand bioinformatics, and data science who mirror the blend of researchers that the candidate will lead in the\\nfuture Their distinguished career paths will serve as a template for the candidate's success. To achieve his\\nlong-term career goal, in conjunction with his mentoring team, the candidate has methodically carved out a 4-\\nyear career development program. This program will provide him essential skills in Raman spectroscopy,\\nintegration of multidimensional biomedical data, clinical translational research, EoE, grant writing, and\\nleadership. The preeminent mentorship, rigorous career development plan, and clinical time under the\\nauspices of this K23 award will lead to publications, data, and experience that will uniquely situate the\\ncandidate as an independent investigator at the intersection of EoE, biophotonics, and data science.\",\"project_title\":\"Precision Medicine Approaches for Eosinophilic Esophagitis Using Raman Spectroscopy and Machine Learning\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\n As a debilitating disease, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) affects 1 in 2000 individuals in the United\\nStates.

Bioinformatics Core\\nThe objective of this Bioinformatics Core is to support statistical and bioinformatics analyses to\\nstudy the effects of osteoporosis anabolic therapies (romosozumab, a sclerostin inhibitor, Scl-\\nAb) on osteoblast progenitors as well as osteocytes in clinical and pre-clinical studies with\\nanabolic therapies. A short anabolic treatment window from Scl-Ab has been reported; in\\ncontrast to teriparatide (PTH) that has a longer anabolic window. This Bioinformatics Core will\\nserve as the critical foundation for the research projects by analyzing cross-species data from\\nsingle cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq using innovative techniques and approaches.\\nThe capabilities of the Bioinformatics Core will be enhanced by being able to leverage existing\\ndatasets of whole genome sequencing in tens thousands of human samples; and osteocyte\\ngene expression signatures and deeply skeletal phenotyping from a unique mouse knockout\\ndataset from our collaborators. To support Project #1, Project #2 as well as pilot projects, the\\nBioinformatics Core will provide statistical design, computational analysis, data quality control\\nand management support as well as accessing to other external human genetics and\\nbioinformatics data and resource. Specifically, in Aim 1, the Bioinformatics Core seeks to build a\\nsynergistic data management, data analytical and bioinformatics pipelines over cloud\\ncomputing environment which allows interaction within investigators through data collection,\\ndata analyses, information sharing and data interpretation. In Aim 2, the Core will provide\\nstatistical and bioinformatics analyses for scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq generated from clinical\\nand pre-clinical studies to identify osteoblast precursor cell clusters over time with either Scl-Ab\\nor PTH treatments; osteoblast lineage tracing; osteoblast progenitors and osteocytes gene\\nexpression patterns; and co-expression pattern over time. In addition, cross-species integrating\\nanalysis will be conducted to identify homologous and divergent cell types between human and\\nmice. In Aim 3, we will prioritize genes regulating bone formation and Identify molecular\\nsignatures affecting treatment effect via human gene expression (in bone biopsies) and genetic\\nvariation associated with bone phenotypes (BMD, HR-PQCT derived bone structure, fracture) in\\nlarge-scale whole genome sequenced studies. In Aim 4, To further characterize skeletal function\\nand phenotypes of the genes identified from project# and project#2 transcriptome analyses, we\\nwill utilize the existing KO mice deep phenotyping data; and generate a new KO mice strain.\\nUltimately, these merged analyses will generate powerfully informed, novel hypotheses\\nregarding bone stem cell biology and responses to bone anabolic agents.\",\"project_title\":\"Bioinformatics Core\",\"phr_text\":\"Project Narrative – Bioinformatics Core\\nThe goal of this Bioinformatics Core is to support statistical and bioinformatics analyses to study\\nthe effects of osteoporosis anabolic therapies on osteoblast progenitors as well as osteocytes in\\nclinical and pre-clinical studies.

HA-RVI are preventable through appropriate treatment and infection control measures, but\\nincomplete diagnosis leads to missed opportunities for intervention. Taking advantage of these opportunities\\nfor intervention might require additional diagnostic testing and expanded infection control measures. The\\ndegree to which these approaches would be cost-effective is unclear. Therefore, there is a need to define the\\nburden and clinical impact of respiratory viruses in the hospital setting to inform optimal diagnostic, treatment\\nand infection prevention strategies. The overall objective of this project is to support Josh Petrie, PhD in the\\ndevelopment of expertise in healthcare epidemiology, state-of-the-art molecular methods, and advanced\\nmodeling techniques. This objective will be completed through focused training and career development\\nactivities in healthcare epidemiology, next generation sequencing, bioinformatics, cost-effectiveness analysis,\\nand mathematical modeling that is overseen by an excellent team of mentors. The skills developed by the\\ntraining and career development objectives will be strengthened by mentored research to accomplish the\\nfollowing Specific Aims: (1) Define the epidemiology and burden of community-acquired and hospital-\\nassociated respiratory virus infections and compare clinical impact by viral species; (2) Improve the sensitivity\\nand specificity of case definitions to identify hospital-associated influenza cases by integrating clinical,\\nepidemiologic, and molecular data; and (3) Determine the cost-effectiveness of increased respiratory virus\\nscreening and expanded infection control measures to reduce HA-RVI using mathematical models. Completion\\nof the training and research programs will represent the next step on Dr. Petrie's path toward achieving his\\nlong term goal of establishing an independent research program that uses multidisciplinary laboratory and\\nanalytic methodologies to investigate the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses. The expected\\nresearch outcomes of the proposed project are, 1) identification of respiratory viruses that, in addition to\\ninfluenza, are responsible for the greatest number of HA-RVI and result in the most severe clinical outcomes;\\n2) development of methodology for improved identification of HA-RVI through integration of clinical,\\nepidemiologic, and molecular data; and 3) determination of cost-effective diagnostic testing and intervention\\nimplementation strategies for HA-RVI prevention. The proposed research is significant because it is expected\\nthat the outcomes of this work and future studies that build upon it, will lead to reductions in morbidity,\\nmortality, and healthcare costs associated with HA-RVI. This research is innovative both in its focus on a large\\npanel of important respiratory viruses and its use of cross-disciplinary methodology that allows for new\\navenues of research.\",\"project_title\":\"Hospital-Associated Respiratory Virus Infections: Molecular Epidemiology, Clinical Outcomes, and Cost-Effectiveness of Interventions\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\nThe proposed research is relevant to public health because incomplete diagnosis of hospital-associated\\nrespiratory virus infections (HA-RVI) is a barrier to effective infection control and prevention efforts leading to\\nincreased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.

Despite efforts to\\ncharacterize the pathophysiology of PTSD and its heterogenity, no objective biomarker have been established\\nto aid in diagnosis, and prediction of treatment response. This K01 presents a program for research and training\\nthat will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an independent investigator, focused on utilizing a\\ndata-driven computational approach and machine learning techniques to identify multimodal neural biomarkers\\nof PTSD (supervised) and multimodal biotypes of PTSD (unsupervised) and explore whether such biotypes could\\nbe used to predict response to prolonged exposure (PE), the first line treatment for PTSD. The training plan\\nbuilds on the candidate’s prior training and experience and capitalizes on a mentorship team and a research\\nenvironment to foster development of the candidate’s expertise in 1) the neural and behavioral basis of PTSD\\nand anxiety disorders; 2) multimodal data fusion analysis and latent dimension interpretation with data-driven\\ncomputational approaches and data reproducibility; and 3) patient-oriented translational research in anxiety\\ndisorders. This research project will apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques on\\nmultimodal MRI data from the largest existing PTSD dataset (N~3000 from the ENIGMA-PTSD working group).\\nBiotypes identified from this large dataset will then be extended to clinical treatment data. The results of the\\nproposed research will be vital to aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment\\noutcomes through different biotype targets and will lead to a future R01 grant examining brain-symptoms\\nassociation across anxiety and trauma-related disorders, and to use the newly identified PTSD biotypes to inform\\ndifferent treatment outcomes in a following R61/33. Together, the research and training experiences and\\nexpertise developed through this K01 award will support the applicant’s transition to research independence and\\nensure the applicant becomes a leading authority in the application of data-driven computational approaches in\\npsychiatry research, and provide the basis for future NIMH grants to explore biotypes from multimodal brain\\nimaging using data-driven computational approaches across anxiety-related disorders.\",\"project_title\":\"Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study\",\"phr_text\":\"PTSD can occur after a direct or indirect traumatic experience and is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder.\\nThis research project use a big data and data-driven approaches to study the heterogenity of PTSD.

Absence of direct support and training can be a barrier when\\nthese students pursue advanced biomedical degrees. Ultimately fewer underrepresented individuals hold\\ndoctoral degrees, have careers in biomedicine, thereby exacerbating health disparities in the United States\\n(U.S.). The objective of this program is to recruit and train at least five participants per year for an intensive,\\nmentored experience in biomedical research with the goal to prepare them for pursuing a graduate degree in\\nbiomedicine. In preparing scholars to be competitive and successful in graduate programs, we will use a\\ncompetency-based educational framework to build their skills in research and self-efficacy. The primary aims of\\nOHSU PREP are to 1) provide a sustained research-intensive experience to prepare students for graduate\\nprograms with research faculty mentors who have received mentor training to ensure success with this\\npopulation of scholars; and 2) provide competency-based professional and career skills development. Scholars\\nwill be paired with a faculty mentor and pursue a year-long independent research project aligned with the\\nscholar’s interests and receive additional mentorship from the Program Directors and Program Coordinator in\\nweekly meetings that build their skills and confidence in self-efficacy and professional identity. Each scholar\\nwill develop an individual development plan in order to understand their career and professional development\\nneeds, participate in similar activities as incoming first year PhD students, and take graduate-level courses with\\nan emphasis on ethics and data analytics. We will offer directed preparation for graduate school, including\\ngraduate school applications, study skills and time management, critical thinking, and resilience. Scholars, with\\ntheir mentors, are expected to develop their research projects for presentation at local and national meetings\\nand prepare a research paper for publication and/or deposition in the OHSU Institutional Repository.\\nParticipants will also receive individualized writing instruction, as well as preparation for the GRE, as needed.\\nAs proposed, OHSU PREP will build on existing opportunities that allow for cultural immersion through\\ninteractions with near-peer mentors (i.e., graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) and OHSU faculty from\\nunderrepresented backgrounds. We expect that at least 75% of our participants will successfully enter and\\ncomplete graduate programs in biomedical science and that the program will function as a bridge to ease the\\ntransition of recent college graduates into PhD-conferring programs.\",\"project_title\":\"OHSU PREP - Guiding Promising Underrepresented Post-Baccalaureates to be Successful Biomedical Scholars\",\"phr_text\":\"Project Narrative\\nReducing health disparities requires a diverse biomedical workforce.

diseases and conditions, as well as a disproportionate burden of the negative health\\nconsequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 2021, the cumulative COVID case rate in Utah per\\n100,000 was 10,803 among Whites vs. 17,541 among Latinos. The positivity rate was 14% among Whites vs.\\n24% among Latinos. Similar disparities persist across the nation regarding vaccination rates between urban vs.\\nrural, high vs. low SES, and White vs. non-White populations. Low vaccination rates leave underserved popula-\\ntions at risk for local outbreaks, and more contagious and severe variants. Thus, interventions targeting these\\npopulations at the interplay between testing and vaccination are critical for pandemic control. Not only do un-\\nderserved populations experience profound health inequities, but there is also a critical digital divide between\\nhigh and low resource healthcare systems. Low resource settings are far less likely to adopt Health Information\\nTechnology approaches, and often do not have the capacity to implement large scale population health man-\\nagement (PHM) efforts utilizing data analytics and automated patient outreach. Community Health Centers\\n(CHCs) are optimal settings for implementing these PHM interventions to increase the uptake of COVID-19\\ntesting and vaccination among underserved populations. Eleven Utah CHC systems are participating in\\nSCALE-UP II. Their 38 primary care clinics serve over 112,000 unique underserved patients annually. Sup-\\nported by a RADx-UP Phase I grant (SCALE-UP Utah), we have established a flexible text messaging outreach\\nand patient navigation infrastructure with CHCs to increase testing and vaccine uptake. SCALE-UP II will lev-\\nerage this infrastructure as well as long standing partnerships among the University of Utah Clinical and\\nTranslational Science Institute, Association for Utah Community Health, CHCs across the entire state, and the\\nUtah Department of Health. SCALE-UP II will investigate three PHM interventions at the interplay between\\nCOVID-19 vaccination and testing: 1) Text Messaging (TM) – bidirectional text messaging with a one-touch\\nresponse to connect patients to vaccination or mail at-home rapid test kits at no cost for use as needed, 2) Con-\\nversational Agent (CA) – automated, scripted and interactive agent used to mimic human interaction to offer\\naccess to at-home rapid test kits, 3) Patient Navigation (PN) – phone call from a community health worker to\\nhelp address hesitancy and access barriers, and to offer at-home rapid test kits. Two types of PN will be tested:\\nReactive PN (RPN) will reach out only to those patients who reply YES to a TM/CA message. Proactive PN\\n(PPN) will reach out to all patients, including those who do not reply to a TM/CA message. The specific aims\\nare to 1) Conduct a 2 (TM vs. CA) X 3 (No PN vs. RPN vs. PPN) factorial design assessing intervention effects\\non testing uptake among unvaccinated adults 2) Examine factors associated with at-home testing and vaccina-\\ntion uptake over time.\",\"project_title\":\"SCALE UP Utah II: Community-Academic Partnership to Address COVID-19 Testing and Vaccination Among Utah Community Health Centers\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\nRacial/ethnic minority, low socioeconomic status (SES), and rural populations suffer profound health\\ninequities across a wide variety of diseases and conditions, as well as a disproportionate burden of the negative\\nhealth consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

is\\nnecessary for future translational efforts to improve treatment and prevention. This Mentored Career\\nDevelopment Award proposal is tailored to facilitate the candidate’s training in multimodal assessment of brain\\nand behavior, in addition to clinical assessment and computational psychiatry approaches, to elucidate the\\nneurobiology of susceptibility to posttraumatic dysfunction. The proposed research training plan will build the\\ncandidate’s skills in multidimensional assessment of perceptual (i.e., visual) processing in the early aftermath of\\ntrauma, advanced computational modeling of behavioral processes, and ‘big-data’ modeling approaches for\\nfusion of multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. This training is complemented by mentored\\ntraining in clinical assessment of trauma-related dysfunction and research program management necessary for\\ntransition to an independent career as a translational neuroscientist. The completion of the K01 will facilitate the\\ncandidate’s transition to an independent investigator capable of developing new neuroscience-based predictive\\nmodels and preventative strategies to lessen the burden of trauma and stress-related disorders.\\n PTSD is typically conceptualized as a dysfunction of arousal and negative valence systems with the NIH\\nResearch Domain Criteria framework. However, new research demonstrates that neural circuitry of affective\\nvisual perceptual processing, in particular affective visual processing, may be a significant risk factor for PTSD.\\nLimited work to date has probed affective visual circuitry in the early aftermath of trauma. The proposed research\\nwill leverage state-of-the-art MRI data collection and analysis with computational cognitive neuroscience\\napproaches to elucidate impacts of trauma on affective visual processing. The project will thus better\\ncharacterize an understudied aspect of the RDoC perceptual framework in trauma to integrate visual circuitry\\nvariability in both threat-related processes and PTSD-related dysfunction.\\n Previous research in recently traumatized individuals has also not leveraged multimodal data approaches\\nto establish generalizable markers of PTSD susceptibility. This project will address these limitations by focusing\\non perceptual circuits and by integrating pre-existing large datasets of trauma and PTSD with multimodal data\\nfusion analytics to assess the robustness of observed neurobiological signatures of trauma-related dysfunction\\nvulnerability. Further, the proposal seeks to use standardized, open processing pipelines to enhance\\nreproducibility and replicability of observed findings to promote generalizability. The research training plan will\\noccur at McLean Hospital, the leading psychiatric research hospital of Harvard Medical School. The institution,\\nand academic culture in greater Boston provides an outstanding environment and access to resources for\\nsuccessful competition of this proposed Mentored Career Development Award.\",\"project_title\":\"Multimodal characterization of affective visual processing in the early aftermath of trauma\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVACE TO PUBLIC HEALTH\\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) carries significant emotional, financial, and social burdens for affected\\nindividuals and their families.

declining. As a result,\\nsome HIV services are becoming less efficient: HIV prevention is averting fewer infections per client served, and\\nHIV testing yield (i.e., the fraction of tests leading to new diagnoses) is declining. Given resource constraints,\\nHIV prevention and testing programs will need to increase efficiency in order to maintain momentum toward\\nepidemic control. Specifically, a precision public health approach could be used to focus services where their\\nhealth benefits would be greatest. Precision public health has been challenging to implement in SSA’s\\ngeneralized HIV epidemics because most transmission is not confined to identifiable key populations, eluding\\nprecise responses. Until recently, the only tool for describing HIV transmission has been phylogenetic analysis\\nof HIV genome sequences, which is too slow and costly for real-time response at scale. Rapid tests for recent\\nHIV infection (RTRI) recently became available in SSA, offering a novel opportunity to identify active transmission\\nclusters and respond with precision. RTRI detects high-avidity antibodies that appear approximately one year\\nafter HIV infection. If only low-avidity antibodies are detected, this infection likely occurred in the past year.\\nZambia is an early adopter of RTRI and followed-up two-thirds of positive HIV tests with RTRI in 2021. Despite\\nthe large scale of Zambia’s RTRI program, it has not been evaluated in terms of impact or cost-effectiveness,\\nand outbreak response thresholds have not been optimized. However, the wealth of data now collected by the\\nRTRI program could guide higher-performing, next-generation outbreak response strategies. Our team has\\nexpertise in Zambian HIV policy, program implementation, health economics, bioethics, geospatial analysis,\\nmachine learning, and infectious disease modeling. We helped to develop the only HIV social network model\\nrigorously validated to predict HIV incidence, prevalence, and transmission patterns in SSA, which has been\\nused for international and country-level HIV policy decision-making for over a decade. We propose to partner\\nwith the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ), a Zambian-run NGO that has been\\nsupporting MoH for over a decade in HIV policy-making and implementation (including RTRI), to (Aim 1)\\ndetermine whether the RTRI program can help Zambia achieve its epidemic control goals, (Aim 2) measure the\\ncost and estimate the cost-effectiveness of the RTRI program, and (Aim 3) use “big data” methods to design\\nnext-generation outbreak responses, taking into account trade-offs of sensitivity vs. specificity, precision vs.\\nease-of-use, and precision vs. avoidance of collecting potentially stigmatizing data elements. While pursuing\\nscientific Aims and hypotheses aligned with the NOSI “Harnessing Big Data to Halt HIV”, we will also have direct\\npolicy impact by providing real-time analytics, HIV outbreak mapping, and input for RTRI policy decision-making.\",\"project_title\":\"Rapid Tests for Recent Infection (RTRI) for Precision Public Health in Sub-Saharan Africa: Next-Generation Strategies Amid Changing HIV Epidemiology\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\nHIV is a top cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, but rates of new infections are declining, so that HIV\\nprevention services avert fewer infections per client served, and HIV testing services lead to fewer new HIV-\\npositive diagnoses per test conducted.

Standing orders\\n(written protocols that authorize designated members of the healthcare team to vaccinate without first obtaining\\na patient-specific physician order) have been shown to work in inpatient settings and for adults, but have not\\nbeen evaluated for HPV vaccine, which some parents consider controversial.

We propose testing standing\\norders for HPV vaccine in an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) in Western New York, and assessing\\nwhich provider and practice factors moderate the effect of standing orders.

structure on toxicant exposures and life course health in the\\nELEMENT cohort\\nSUMMARY\\nTraditional epidemiological research and methods often focus separately on how social, economic, and environmental\\nfactors affect individuals’ life course health, yet evolving research underscores the importance of considering the\\nintegrated effects of factors that cluster in those who are most socially disadvantaged. Multiple mechanistic pathways\\nwith complex linkages must also be taken into account to understand the effects of social structures and chemical\\nexposures that underlie environmental health disparities. This challenge depends not only on the integration of measures\\nof socioeconomic status into environmental cohort studies, but also qualitative and geographic information on\\nneighborhood infrastructure and social conditions that can illuminate individuals’ lived experiences and facilitate new\\nscientific directions. While substantial research examines the developmental origins and biologic mechanisms underlying\\ntoxicant-health associations, few cohorts have the ability to address the intergenerational legacy of toxicant exposures\\nand social structures on life course health.1 This U24 competitive renewal application leverages the rich data and research\\ninfrastructure of the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to ENvironmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) cohort. Here, we propose\\nexpanding our E3Gen cohort maintenance activities to integrate novel measures of social structure and ethnographic data\\ninto our biologic and data repositories in this unique, multi-generational cohort of mother-child dyads followed for ~28\\nyears. This expansion also will implement streamlined protocols to enhance follow-up and engage the original ELEMENT\\noffspring as they transition to adulthood and begin to have children of their own, setting the stage for research examining\\nthe impact of social and environmental exposures on reproductive and metabolic health and development across 3\\ngenerations. Specific aims are to: 1) Create and collect household and individual qualitative and quantitative data to\\nunderstand the direct effects of social and economic stressors and their potential to modify the multigenerational, life\\ncourse effects of environmental exposures on health outcomes. 2) Encourage participation and prevent loss to follow up\\namong ~600 ELEMENT offspring now aged 16-28 years and establish passive surveillance to recruit their children currently\\nand projected to be born over the next 5 years. 3) Develop and test novel, nonlinear multidimensional methods to\\nintegrate and harmonize qualitative and quantitative data, foster cross-project data communication and novel\\ninterdisciplinary partnerships, and accelerate data sharing with the larger environmental health sciences community.\\nThrough our existing partnerships with minority-serving institutions Hampton and Fisk Universities and Spelman College,\\nwe will train diverse students in environmental epidemiology, global public health and biostatistics via summer\\nundergraduate internships and accelerated master’s degree programs.\\n1 Gochfeld, Michael, and Joanna Burger. \\\"Disproportionate exposures in environmental justice and other populations: the importance of outliers.\\\" American Journal\\nof Public Health 101.S1 (2011): S53-S63.\",\"project_title\":\"E3Gen: Multigenerational Influences of Social Structure on Toxicant Exposures and Life Course Health in the ELEMENT Cohort\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\nTraditional epidemiological research and methods often focus separately on how social, economic, and\\nenvironmental factors affect individuals' life course health, yet evolving research underscores the importance of\\nconsidering the integrated effects of factors that cluster in those who are most socially disadvantaged.

A 'Wish\\nTo Die' (WTD) is an indicator of passive suicide ideation which refers to thoughts of one’s own death, that one would\\nbe better off dead, or wishing for one’s death. The association between social disconnection and suicide is widely\\nrecognised and social disconnection has been shown to be associated with an increased likelihood of WTD.\\nImportantly, social disconnection is a multi-faceted construct and both the quantity (social isolation) and quality\\n(loneliness) of people’s social relationships are strongly related to both suicide ideation and subsequent suicide\\nattempts. While this association is well-established, the mechanistic pathways to explain the association are less well\\nunderstood. The main putative mechanisms proposed are: behavioral (sleep, physical activity, smoking, alcohol\\nconsumption), psychological (depression, anxiety, and ageing perceptions), and physiological (neuroendocrine,\\nimmune function, and cardiometabolic).\\nThis study leverages data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) to identify the pathways that explain\\nthe association between social disconnection and passive suicidal ideation. TILDA is a large, nationally\\nrepresentative, prospective cohort study that examines the social, economic and health circumstances of 8,500+\\ncommunity-dwelling adults aged 50 years and older in Ireland. TILDA data have been collected every two years since\\n2009 and includes both survey data (CAPI and SCQ) and a comprehensive clinic-based health assessment. Detailed\\nbiomarker data are available from these health assessments and include markers from the neuroendocrine, immune,\\ncardiometabolic, and parasympathetic systems.\\nUsing this longitudinal data, the study aims to: (1) Identify who is at highest risk of social disconnection and WTD\\namong older adults as well as when individuals are most at risk; (2) Examine the nature of the associations between\\nsocial disconnection and WTD, including strength, temporality, and directionality, among older adults; (3) Identify\\nmechanistic pathways that explain the association between social disconnection and WTD. To address these aims,\\nfour waves of survey and two waves of biomarker data will be investigated and advanced longitudinal statistical\\ntechniques (GLMM, latent growth curve, latent class growth analysis, and SEM path analysis) will be applied.\\nGiven the complex nature of this study, we have assembled an outstanding multi-disciplinary team of clinical and\\nacademic researchers with expertise in each of the constituent parts of the project. By establishing the causal\\npathways between social disconnection and WTD, study results will identify important risk and protective factors for\\nsuicidal ideation that are amenable to intervention. In doing so, the study will inform effective clinical and\\ncommunity-based interventions by which the train of thoughts leading to active suicidal ideation can be stopped\\nbefore individuals progress to active ideation and suicidal behavior.\",\"project_title\":\"Pathways from social disconnection to suicidal ideation in later life\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\nSocial disconnection and suicidal behaviours in later life are important and related public health concerns.

greatly in molecular biology, etiology, and\\npresentation of symptoms. While it accounts for 2.5% of all cancers among women, it results in roughly 5%\\nof cancer-related deaths due to its high fatality rate. This is because 75% of patients are diagnosed with\\nadvanced disease, largely attributed to its relatively late presentation of symptoms and a lack of reliable\\ndetection and monitoring strategies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by all cells, including ovarian\\ncancer, and their cargo reflects their cells of origin. They have shown immense potential as stable\\nbiomarkers, however their low abundance compared to EVs from healthy cells and a lack of sufficiently\\nsensitive characterization tools has limited their clinical translation. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy\\n(SERS) is sensitive enough to biochemically fingerprint even single EVs, and the information-rich spectra\\nproduced in EV SERS can be fed into machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify them based on their\\nlatent spectral features. Despite early progress in EV SERS, the highly heterogeneous nature of EVs\\nindicates that their separation into distinct subpopulations prior to SERS analysis may help improve disease\\ndiagnosis, classification, and monitoring. Microfluidic devices are uniquely capable of separating EV s into\\nsubpopulations of interest while simultaneously enabling SERS spectral acquisition in a single device. In the\\nproposed research, during the mentored phase, ML-enabled inverse design will be combined with high\\nresolution nanofabrication techniques to improve the signal strength and spectral quality attainable from EV\\nSERS. Preliminary data indicates that the SERS enhancement is highly dependent on the substrate’s\\nnanoscale geometry, which is particularly important for EVs compared to conventional chemical analysis.\\nTowards the end of the mentored phase, once the improved substrates have been thoroughly tested using\\nbioreactor-produced EVs, they will be incorporated into two distinct microfluidic devices and tested\\nthroughout the independent phase using both cell culture and patient EV samples. One device will capture\\ndifferent subpopulations of EVs directly onto the microfluidic SERS substrates based on specific surface-\\nantigens for multiplexed characterization, while the other will separate EVs precisely by size and flow them\\nover the microfluidic SERS substrates to produce EV SERS barcodes. In parallel, ML algorithms tailored\\nspecifically to these platforms will also be developed to process and classify the acquired spectra. This\\nproposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing advanced ML and micro-nanofabrication techniques as well as EV\\nproduction, isolation, and characterization strategies. These experiments are innovative and significant\\nbecause they will develop ML inverse design architectures specifically for EVs as well as microfluidic EV\\nSERS for characterizing and classifying ovarian cancer.\",\"project_title\":\"Machine Learning-enabled Classification of Extracellular Vesicles Using Nanoplasmonic Microfluidics\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\nOvarian cancer is a major public health issue and is often diagnosed in later stages, resulting in an\\nincreased risk of death.

project research laboratories and pilot project recipients. The integrated services of the Core range\\nfrom the imaging capabilities of simple microscopes to imaging analysis by sophisticated and advanced\\nimaging methodologies. The Imaging Core personnel assist users to operate the instruments and analyze\\nimaging data. The Core provides advice for the current PIs in this Center of Biomedical Research Excellence\\n(COBRE) application to use the Imaging Core for their specific studies. The Imaging Core has provided\\ntremendous help to the projects in Phase I of COBRE support and will continue to make its services readily\\navailable and easily accessible to all COBRE laboratories in order to generate high quality data. Toward the\\ngoals of providing efficient and high-quality imaging services and of establishing a robust imaging infrastructure\\nwithin the CCM, we have added new features and new imaging systems to the Core. Our specific aims are: 1)\\nto provide project-specific training and consultation for COBRE investigators; 2) to develop and adapt state-of-\\nthe art imaging techniques to enhance the research of early-stage and pilot project investigators; and 3) to\\ndevelop and implement new methods, to enhance CCM imaging services and make such services available to\\nCOBRE and non-COBRE users. This Core will provide an easily accessible facility where investigators can\\nevaluate their tissue and/or cellular samples using various types of imaging systems. Dr. Jianhang Jia, the\\nDirector of the Imaging Core, is a highly productive investigator who has successfully obtained substantial\\nextramural research support including an NIGMS Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA) (R35)\\naward for established investigators that relies extensively on sophisticated imaging capabilities. He has worked\\nclosely with all graduated COBRE PIs, making significant contributions to their successes in obtaining\\nindependent research support. Dr. Jia has guided the development of the four CCM research projects in this\\nPhase II application, and he will continue to advise CCM investigators on the design of experiments that use\\nimaging modalities.\",\"project_title\":\"Imaging

technology innovations in brain monitoring to personalize treatment for patients with hypoxic-\\nischemic brain injury post-cardiac arrest. This career development award and its rigorous curriculum will\\nestablish Dr. Amorim as a clinician-scientist with independent expertise in: 1) Deep learning applied to\\nphysiology time-series, 2) Causal inference for observational data, and 3) Quantitative brain imaging. Every\\nyear, more than 500,000 Americans have a cardiac arrest. Brain injury is the number one cause of death for\\npatients surviving initial resuscitation, and refractory seizures and other seizure-like brain activity are\\ndiagnosed in up to 50% of patients. Despite being a common complication, outcomes are dismal and current\\ntreatment strategies for seizures post-cardiac arrest are limited. Dr. Amorim aims to identify physiology-driven\\nbiomarkers of resilience to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury by utilizing state-of-the-art computational methods and\\na massive EEG and neuroimaging dataset with >1,500 subjects. His central hypothesis is that specific time-\\ndependent changes in spike and accompanying EEG activity during cardiac arrest treatment predict seizure\\ncontrol and, ultimately, neurological recovery. The primary objectives of this proposal are: 1) Identify early\\nlongitudinal epileptiform EEG phenotypes predictive of neurological recovery using interpretable and deep\\nlearning algorithms; 2) Establish quantitative EEG biomarkers of seizure treatment response to anesthetics;\\nand 3) Estimate the causal effect of rapid seizure treatment with anesthetics in preventing structural brain\\ninjury quantified with brain MRI. Dr. Amorim has generated preliminary data to demonstrate the feasibility of\\nmodeling EEG phenotypes longitudinally for outcome prediction and has applied quantitative EEG biomarkers\\nto predict degree of brain injury on brain MRI. His primary mentor in this proposal will be Dr. Edward Chang, a\\nneuroscientist and leader in human neurophysiology research. His co-mentors will include Dr. Brandon\\nWestover, an authority in machine learning applied to critical care EEG, and Dr. Donna Ferriero, an\\naccomplished translational and neuroimaging investigator in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Additional\\nmentoring in quantitative neuroimaging (Dr. Srikantan Nagarajan) and biostatistics (Dr. Charles McCulloch) will\\nbe essential components of his training. These aims are expected to establish early non-invasive predictive\\nbiomarkers of neurological recovery and seizure control that may: 1) Guide patient selection for clinical trials\\nenrichment and 2) Serve as target to therapeutic interventions after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. By\\nleveraging the deep expertise of a cross-disciplinary group of world-class mentors and the unparalleled\\ninnovation environments of the University of California, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Dr. Amorim will be\\nideally positioned to uncover fundamental knowledge about epileptogenesis after acute brain injury as well as\\nspearhead clinical trials focused on improving outcomes meaningful to cardiac arrest patients.\",\"project_title\":\"Physiology-driven seizure management post-cardiac arrest\",\"phr_text\":\"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\nCardiac arrest impacts the lives of 500,000 Americans every year, and nearly half of patients\\nsurviving the initial resuscitation will develop seizures or seizure-like brain activity as a complication of\\nhypoxic-ischemic brain injury.
